Oil Gives Up Gains Despite Large Crude Draw.html,"Crude oil prices moved slightly lower today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory decline of 6 million barrels for the week to August 11. That change compared with a build of 5.9 million barrels for the previous week, which in turn followed the biggest inventory draw in years, at 17 million barrels for the last week of July.


 A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute estimated crude oil inventories had shed 6.2 million barrels in the week to August 11. In fuels, the EIA estimated mixed changes in weekly inventory levels. Gasoline inventories shed a modest 300,000 barrels in the reporting period, with production averaging 9.6 million bpd. This compared with an inventory draw of 2.7 million barrels for the previous week, when production averaged 9.9 million barrels daily. In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory increase of 300,000 barrels for the second week of August. Production averaged 4.7 million barrels daily. That compared with an inventory draw of 1.7 million barrels for the previous week, when middle distillate production averaged 4.9 million bpd.


 Oil prices this week have been trending lower on the latest economic data from China, which suggested a slowdown in growth, based on industrial production and retail sales figures for July. At the same time, refinery runs data from China as well suggested demand for oil remains strong and growing. Refiners ramped up processing rates last month, the data said, with the average daily number higher both than the average for June and the average for July 2022. ""Concerns that China's faltering economy will weigh on demand offset tight supply in the oil market,"" ANZ analysts said, as quoted by Reuters. “With the disappointing turn in China’s economic data dominating headlines lately, sentiments around oil prices are being kept in check,” IG Asia analyst Yeap Jun Rong told Bloomberg.

Colombias Controversial Oil And Gas Exploration Ban Explained.html,"When left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro came into power at the beginning of the year, he pledged that he would bring an end to new oil and gas exploration. But as the months go by, some believe he should rethink this approach, putting Colombia’s economy ahead of the green transition. Petro announced in January that he would not be approving any new oil and gas exploration projects and aimed to move Colombia away from its reliance on fossil fuels in favour of clean energy. Irene Vélez, the minister for mines, stated at the World Economic Forum, “We have decided not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts, and while that has been very controversial, it’s a clear sign of our commitment in the fight against climate change… This decision is absolutely urgent and needs immediate action.” This had long been part of Petro’s campaign but not everyone in Congress agrees with this approach.  Colombia continues to rely heavily on oil and gas production for its revenue, a vital contribution to the national economy. At present, the country has a shortage of proven oil and natural gas reserves. In addition, the industry was hit hard during the Covid pandemic, due to pauses in operations and delays in new projects. Production fell from around 884,876 bpd in March 2019 to 771,732 bpd in March 2023. And many of Colombia’s potential areas of exploration are unlikely to be developed due to Petro’s plans to end awarding new exploration contracts and ban hydraulic fracturing, which is deterring new investors. Some international energy companies are even exiting Colombia. 


 A statement from the Ministry of Mines and Energy suggested that Colombia’s oil reserves only expanded by 1.7 percent year-over-year to just 2.074 billion barrels of oil with a commercial life of 7.5 years at the current rate of production. Meanwhile, its proven natural gas reserves, which decreased by 11 percent compared to a year ago, to 2.82 trillion cubic feet, are only enough to support production for 7.2 years. Unless new development is approved, this could turn Colombia into an oil-dependent country, something that seemed near impossible just a few years ago.  Owing to Petro’s plans to curb oil exploration, the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP) forecasts that private investment in exploration will decrease by around a third compared to last year, to achieve between $650 million to $700 million. This will likely lead Colombia to rely more heavily on its existing, dwindling reserves. If it becomes dependent on foreign oil to meet its demand, it would be vulnerable to weaker oil pricesand declining production.  At present, the government is attempting to revive some of its existing oil and gas projects in a bid to keep developing the industry without having to approve new exploration licenses. It hopes to help energy companies revive at least 21 suspended oil and gas contracts through a $38 million initiative, according to the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH). While Petro plans to stop new exploration, he has urged energy companies to develop already-awarded blocks. However, the oil industry continues to demand new licensing rounds to develop areas of significant potential in Colombia.  The ANH recently identified concessions across the country owned by several companies, including Geopark, Gran Tierra Energy, SierraCol Energy, majority state-owned Ecopetrol and Emerald, that could be beneficiaries of its multi-million Territorial Hydrocarbons Strategy. The agency stated, “We've been working on implementing an agreement focused on providing alternatives, to make exploratory activities facing delays in their execution viable.”  Energy companies must conduct community consultations before new projects can get off the ground, but previous governments have not helped in this process. However, the regulator plans to help firms coordinate with communities through entities such as the interior minister, “guaranteeing the development of social dialogue spaces and effective community participation.” 


 There is some cause for optimism as Ecopetrol recently announced a new oil and gas discovery in the Putumayo province. The firm drilled the Alqamari-2 well to a depth of 9,287 feet, achieving a daily flow of 1,800 barrels of oil. In addition, it saw a gas production of up to 825,000 cubic feet per day. This is good news for Ecopetrol, which experienced a decrease in its second-quarter revenue of 61 percent, largely owing to lower oil prices this year. The companies believe the potential resources could be rapidly converted into reserves, boosting Colombia’s hydrocarbons.  While there is still potential to develop Colombia’s licensed hydrocarbon regions, many are doubtful that this will be enough to allow the country to maintain its energy independence. President Petro decided to ban new oil and gas licenses in favour of a green transition, however, energy experts believe this may eventually make Colombia reliant on imports of the fossil fuels, as production decreases dramatically over the next decade. To ensure the country’s energy security it seems that Petro must either allow new licensing to go ahead or rapidly develop the country’s renewable energy sector to fill the anticipated demand gap within the next decade. ",Negative
The Real Reason Russia Is Ramping Up Oil Production In Iraq.html,"Russia took control of the oil sector of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan (KRI) in northern Iraq in 2017 for four key reasons, as analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. First, the KRI has significant oil and gas reserves. Second, its troublesome relationship with southern Iraq, governed out of Baghdad, would allow Russia to play the role of mediator between the two parts of the country, giving it leverage over both sides. Third, this leverage could then be used to extend Russia’s grip over southern Iraq too, which has even more oil and gas reserves. And fourth, it would enable Russia to stymie any efforts by the U.S. and its allies to begin to rebuild their influence in the country. This last point found further resonance after March’s resumption of relationship agreement between Iran (Iraq’s chief regional sponsor) and Saudi Arabia, brokered by China. Specifically, a source who works closely with the European Union’s energy security apparatus exclusively told OilPrice.com at the time, Iran was told by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin that: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq – and closer to the new Iran-Saudi axis - the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise”.  With the future of independent oil supplies from the KRI looking highly precarious, Russia is moving firmly into the last phases of its plan for Iraq, as highlighted by serious discussions over the past two weeks for it to increase its presence in the country’s oil fields. A litmus test for both sides in this respect is Russia finally effecting a major increase in oil production from Iraq’s supergiant West Qurna 2 oil field. This field – along with the supergiant Rumaila – was cited recently by Iraq’s Oil Ministry as being vital to the country’s plan to increase its oil production capacity to around 7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2027. The entire West Qurna oil field, located 65 kilometres northwest of the southern port city of Basra, has total estimated recoverable oil reserves of 43 billion barrels – making it one of the very biggest oil fields in the world. West Qurna 2 has estimated recoverable oil reserves of around 13 billion barrels and, like most of the big fields in Iraq (and Iran, and Saudi Arabia), it benefits from the lowest lifting costs in the world – at just US$1-2 per barrel. The original development plan for the West Qurna 2 field was to produce 1.8 million bpd but this was amended in 2013 to a three-stage plan in which peak production would be 1.2 million bpd. Phase 1 would add around 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the early 30,000 bpd of production from the site’s Mishrif Formation. Phase 2 would add another 400,000 bpd from the full development of the Mishrif Formation. And Phase 3 would add another 650,000 bpd from the development of the deeper Yamama Formation.  Related: Oil Prices Continue To Climb As Pace Of Drilling Continues To Slow However, it was at the time of this transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3, scheduled to start around the middle of 2017, that the trouble started from the Russian side, which is why output from the field has barely moved in years. The genesis of the trouble was that Russia’s key corporate oil proxy in Iraq at the time, Lukoil, believed the level of remuneration it was receiving per barrel drilled was too low. It was being paid US$1.15 per barrel recovered – the lowest rate being paid to any international oil company (IOC) in Iraq at that time and dwarfed by the US$5.50 per barrel being paid to GazpromNeft to develop the Badra oil field. Making matters worse for Lukoil at that point was that it had already spent at least US$8 billion in developing West Qurna 2, and compounding this grievance was the fact that Iraq’s Oil Ministry still owed it around US$6 billion in remuneration on recovered barrels and other development payments. In August 2017, a senior source who works closely with Iran’s Petroleum Ministry exclusively told OilPrice.com at the time, Lukoil was assured that Iraq’s Oil Ministry would very quickly pay the US$6 billion that it owed the company and that a higher compensation rate per barrel would be looked into as soon as was feasible. In addition, the Oil Ministry agreed to extend Lukoil’s contract period from 20 to 25 years, so lowering the average yearly cost to the Russian firm. It was also agreed that Lukoil would invest at least US$1.5 billion in West Qurna 2 in the following 12 months with a view to raising production from the 400,000-bpd level closer to the 1.2 million bpd peak production target.  However, only one month later, 93% of the people of Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan voted in favour of complete independence from Iraq and chaos ensued, seeing Iranian forces move into the KRI, with Russian support. Only one month after that, Russia effectively took control of the region’s oil sector, and looked to put the squeeze on the Federal Government of Iraq (FGI) run out of Baghdad. As also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order, Russia looked to gain more favourable terms for its existing operations in the FGI region, and for new oil field development awards there, by interposing itself between the two sides in their ongoing dispute over the 2014 ‘budget disbursements-for-oil’ deal.  Part of Russia’s manoeuvring at this point was doing nothing to increase production from West Qurna 2. Crucially for what followed, Lukoil knew back then that it was perfectly capable of producing at least 635,000 bpd on a sustained basis. According to the Iran source, the Russian oil firm had hit 650,000 bpd production over extended periods in August and September 2017, and its engineers had assured senior management that 635,000-bpd production was achievable on an ongoing basis with no problems. At the end of November 2017, though, Iraq’s Oil Ministry found out that Lukoil was holding out on them. It threatened to withhold all payments due to Lukoil until it began to increase production steadily up to the 635,000-bpd level that its own production tests had shown was perfectly achievable. In response, and after the withdrawal of several IOCs from Iraq, Lukoil’s senior management thought that the time was right to try again to force the Oil Ministry into honouring its previous promises to increase its per barrel compensation on the West Qurna 2 field. Lukoil added that it was not making the 18.5 percent revenue per year from the field that it had expected – only around 10 percent, in fact - and that the Oil Ministry needed to improve this, otherwise it would exit the project. Surprisingly for the Russians, the Oil Ministry’s response was to say that it was fine if Lukoil wanted to leave but that before it did so it would pay compensation in lieu of the upfront investment that it promised in 2017 and promised again in 2019, as it was not meeting the time-sensitive oil production targets that it had agreed to.  From that point, the standoff remained in place, up until recently. According to the Iran source, Lukoil has increased production over the past few weeks from 400,000 bpd to around 480,000 bpd. “From this point it could be increased back above 600,000 bpd in just a few weeks, and it looks like the Russians are serious this time he added,” he said. “With the Iran-Saudi deal, the last part of Russia’s move with China to secure the whole region [Middle East] is in play,” he added. “A unified Iraq is a key element of this, as the three countries together [Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia] are the heart of the Middle East and the heart of its oil and gas reserves, so to have control over that is a huge geopolitical advantage, and one the Americans wanted as well before their plan fell apart,” he concluded.",Negative
US Shale Shakes Off Slowdown Predictions.html,"The U.S. shale patch, which accounts for most of the non-OPEC+ oil supply growth, is set to deliver stronger-than-anticipated production gains this year.  Several significant producers raised their production guidance after announcing strong or record output in the second quarter, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) raised its 2023 production forecast in its latest monthly report. The International Energy Agency (IEA) also expects strong output gains from the United States to lead a record global supply this year.  


 In the past few weeks, some major U.S. producers reported record output in the Permian, while others raised their outlooks for year-on-year gains.  Chevron reported a record-high Permian Basin production, which increased by 11% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the year-ago period.  ""Strong execution resulted in record Permian Basin production this quarter,"" chairman and chief executive officer Mike Wirth said.  Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production rose by 2% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to record Permian production of 772,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). Chevron plans to further increase its investments in the United States with the announced agreement to acquire PDC Energy, Inc. The other U.S. supermajor, ExxonMobil, achieved record quarterly production in the Permian and Guyana in Q2.  ""Production is up 20% year-over-year in Guyana and the Permian,"" said chairman and CEO Darren Woods.  ConocoPhillips, for its part, also delivered record production in the second quarter, driven by the Lower 48 output.  ""We achieved record production and increased our full-year production guidance for the second consecutive quarter,"" said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer.  Full-year production is now expected to be 1.80-1.81 million boepd, compared to the prior guidance of 1.78-1.80 million boepd. 


 Pioneer Natural Resources saw its Q2 oil production near the top end of the guidance range. ""Continued strong well productivity and highly efficient operations underpin our ability to increase full-year production guidance, while lowering full-year capital guidance through a purposeful reduction in activity,"" Rich Dealy, President and Chief Operating Officer, said.  Total production for 2023 is now expected to range from 697,000 boepd to 717,000 boepd, an increase of 22,000 boepd at the midpoint when compared to original 2023 guidance.  Occidental's second-quarter production of 1.218 million boepd exceeded the mid-point of guidance by 42,000 boepd, and the company raised full-year production guidance to 1.21 million boepd.  ""Our team's technical achievements have positioned us for a strong second half of 2023, giving us confidence to raise full-year oil and gas production guidance,"" President and CEO Vicki Hollub said.  Pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners is getting upbeat messages from producers about activity, Tony Chovanec, VP Fundamentals and Supply Appraisal, said on the midstream operator's Q2 earnings call.  ""Watch what the producers are saying on -- during the second quarter. No one has a bad story. Everybody is very, very upbeat,"" Chovanec told analysts.  The EIA is also upbeat on U.S. crude oil production and raised last week its forecasts in the latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for August.

 ADVERTISEMENT As a result of higher expected well-level productivity and higher crude oil prices, the EIA now expects U.S. crude oil production will average 12.8 million bpd in 2023 and 13.1 million bpd in 2024, both annual records. The forecasts were raised by 200,000 bpd for 2023 and by 300,000 bpd for 2024 compared to the projections in July.  As in previous years, the United States is leading non-OPEC+ production growth.  The IEA said in its Oil Market Report last week that global oil output is projected to expand by 1.5 million bpd to a record 101.5 million bpd in 2023, with the U.S. driving non-OPEC+ gains of 1.9 million bpd.  In July 2023, OPEC+ production of 50.7 million bpd was down by more than 2 million bpd from the start of the year. Over the same period, producers outside the group ramped up output by 1.6 million bpd to 50.2 million bpd, the agency said.  The U.S., Brazil, and Guyana lead the expansion, with exports from the trio rising by roughly 15% year over year to more than 9 million bpd in July, boosting the availability of light sweet grades in the Atlantic Basin. The U.S. will account for nearly 80% of global 2023 supply growth, or 1.2 million bpd of the 1.5 million bpd total, the IEA noted.      ",Positive
UAE Is The Biggest Winner Of Saudi Arabia Production Cuts.html,"Last month, the UAE declared it will not join Saudi Arabia in making voluntary oil production cuts, claiming that the cuts by the Saudis are enough to balance the markets. This is hardly surprising considering that the UAE has long argued that it should be allowed to pump more than its current OPEC quota. But OPEC’s third largest producer was not content to just maintain its current production. The UAE got a huge concession from OPEC in the form of an upward revision of its quota that will take its production up by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to 3.2 million barrels.  But the UAE does not have to wait till 2024 to reap the rewards of its shrewdness. Oil prices have climbed about 15% since Saudi Arabia started its voluntary cuts of 1 million barrels per day. In effect, Saudi Arabia is doing all the heavy lifting but the UAE is profiting the most. 


 The UAE has plans to ramp up its crude production capacity to five million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, well above OPEC’s quota of 3 mb/d. “Saudi Arabia is cutting massively. At least Russia says it’s cutting. The UAE has cut to the bare minimum. The end result is that Saudi Arabia is doing all the work and the UAE has oil prices 15 percent higher than they were a month ago. By any means, the UAE is the big winner this summer,” Viktor Katona, the head of crude analysis at Kpler, has told Middle East Eye. The situation is even more ironic when you consider that the UAE is much richer than Saudi Arabia on a per capita basis, meaning Saudi is more worried about short-term prices that could take a toll on government spending. At the current production rate, Saudi Arabia needs $100-a-barrel crude to balance its books. Deeper Saudi Cuts? The UAE might see its revenues shoot up once more if Saudi Arabia decides to make even deeper production cuts as it tries to goose oil prices.  Related: Oil Majors Eye Higher Shale Output This Year Last month, several commodity experts predicted the Saudis will prolong its voluntary production cut but taper off their extra cut by restoring 250,000-500,000 barrels a day of halted production in September. A week later, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) published confirmation that the country will indeed extend its 1 million barrels per day (mb/d) oil output cut into September, but with an important nuance that was largely missed by much of the media coverage that the cut “can be extended or extended and deepened”. This marks the first time Saudi Arabia has signaled a willingness to make even deeper cuts if the previous ones are taking too long to achieve the desired effect.


 Weakening demand by major oil consumers might also persuade Saudi Arabia to cut even further. The latest data coming from China shows that crude oil imports fell 2.412mb/d m/m to a sixth-month low of 10.429mb/d as stockpiling wanes. It’s not clear if this is the beginning of a downtrend since June’s imports were the second highest on record as inventory building hit a torrid clip. To be fair, the y/y increase in crude oil imports in July was a hefty 1.519mb/d, 17% higher than the volume a year ago. Meanwhile, India’s oil demand for the month of July clocked in at 4.70mb/d, weaker than Wall Street’s expectations of 4.83mb/d. The country’s pace of y/y demand growth slowed from 190 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) in June to 84kb/d in July. The data here again is mixed because gasoline demand growth increased to 6.3% in July from 6.2% in June while diesel demand growth increased to 3.9% from 3.1%. But deeper Saudi cuts are not a given.  Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have wagered that Saudi Arabia will not deepen its cuts because crude inventories are likely to fall sharply going forward. Most energy experts have predicted that global oil markets will gradually tighten, which should boost prices as the months and quarters roll on. The International Energy Agency(IEA) in Paris has predicted an oil shortage of about 1.7 million barrels a day during the second half of the year.

 ADVERTISEMENT Commodity experts at Standard Chartered have predicted that global oil markets will register a supply deficit of 2.81 million barrels per day in August; 2.43mb/d in September and more than 2mb/d in November and December. The analysts have also projected that global inventories will fall by 310mb by end-2023 and another 94mb in the first quarter of 2024 thus pushing oil prices higher. According to StanChart, Brent prices will climb to $93/bbl in the fourth quarter.",Negative
Oil Gas Drilling Still Stalling As Prices Climb.html,"The total number of active drilling rigs in the United States fell by 5 again this week, according to new data from Baker Hughes published Friday. The total rig count fell to 654 this week. So far this year, Baker Hughes has estimated a loss of 125 active drilling rigs. This week’s count is 421 fewer rigs than the rig count at the beginning of 2019 prior to the pandemic.


 The number of oil rigs stayed the same this week at 525, down by 96 so far in 2023. The number of gas rigs fell by 5 to 123, a loss of 33 active gas rigs from the start of the year. Miscellaneous rigs stayed the same. The rig count in the Permian Basin slipped by 2 rigs—19 rigs below this same time last year. The rig count in the Eagle Ford fell by 1, and is now 19 fewer than this time last year. Primary Vision’s Frac Spread Count, an estimate of the number of crews completing unfinished wells (which is cheaper than drilling new wells), fell again this week. The frac spread count slipped to 257 in the week ending August 4, down from 268 in the week prior. The frac spread count is 1 fewer than where it started the year. Crude oil production levels in the United States rose to 12.6 million bpd in the week ending August 4, according to the latest weekly EIA estimates—the highest production levels according to weekly data since 2019.

EV Adoption Could Spell Trouble For Oil Exporters.html,"As of 2022, the global car count stood at approximately 1.474 billion, with electric vehicles (EVs) accounting for 1.76%. The rise of EVs is increasingly being seen as a potential challenge to the future of the oil industry. Asia has the world's largest concentration of cars, accounting for 36.8% (543 million vehicles) and consuming 35.7% of the daily 100.255 million barrels in 2022. Europe and North America follow, with Europe having a car population of 413 million and North America 358 million. Interestingly, while Europe boasts the second-largest number of vehicles, its oil consumption is significantly less than that of North America. 


 Two main reasons account for this: EVs, having been on the periphery since 2010, started showing potential for significant industry impact by 2022. With 26 million EVs worldwide, transportation trends are evidently shifting. This shift is powered by technological innovations, environmental awareness, governmental policies, and the evolution of EV charging infrastructure. In 2016, the “Energy Post” published an article titled ""Wake up call for oil companies: electric vehicles will deflate oil demand"" Fast forward to a post-Covid world, and the automobile industry, recovering from global economic shocks, is veering more aggressively toward EVs. As you can see in the chart below, the actual sales data for EVs and the predictions set forth in alternative 2016 scenarios. Up until 2021, the high-case prediction closely mirrored the actual sales numbers. However, 2022 took the industry by surprise, witnessing a record-breaking surge in EV sales — an impressive jump of over 14 million. This upward trajectory pushed total electric car sales to 26.2 million in 2022, up from 12 million in the previous year. Remarkably, EVs made up 14% of all new car sales in 2022, a significant increase from 9% in 2021 and a mere 5% in 2020.  The global electric vehicle (EV) market is primarily driven by three major players. China stands at the forefront, contributing to a staggering 60% of global EV sales. As a testament to its rapid adoption, over half of the world's electric cars now traverse China's roads. Impressively, China has surpassed its 2025 goal for new energy vehicle sales ahead of time. Europe, coming in second, saw its electric car sales surge by over 15% in 2022. This means that for every five cars sold in Europe, one was electric. The U.S., although third in line, experienced a notable 55% boost in its EV sales during the same year, capturing 8% of the country's total car sales. The global trend is promising, with EV sales set to maintain their momentum. In the first quarter alone, sales topped 2.3 million, a 25% increase compared to the previous year. By the close of 2023, the projection stands at a cumulative 40 million electric cars worldwide. While the drive toward EV adoption is fueled by soaring oil prices and growing environmental concerns, high-oil-importing nations find themselves in a favorable position. However, a challenge they must confront is the prevalent electricity shortfall. Given the dynamic state of electric vehicle (EV) adoption, it's crucial to regularly revise our models. This article endeavors to predict the number of EVs up to 2040 based on three divergent scenarios. Subsequently, we aim to gauge the potential reduction in global oil demand resulting from EV expansion. Assumptions and Methodology: Our assumptions pivot around the average oil consumption as of 2022 and the prevailing number of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.


 We assume that the transport sector accounts for 60% of global oil consumption. For instance, Asia's oil consumption in 2022 was 35.7 MMBD, of which 21.42 MMBD (60%) was attributed to transport. Other regions followed a similar method. The global daily average oil consumption per car is estimated at 1.544078 gallons. Regional averages vary based on factors such as vehicle type, travel habits, fuel efficiency, and infrastructure. In 2022, the figures were: Asia at 1.6567, Europe at 0.89, North America at 1.73, and the rest of the world at 1.89 gallons/day/car. Here you can see the projected EV adoption based on our scenarios:  Projections are largely shaped by recent trends over distant historical data. Initial assumptions have higher growth rates, decreasing by 20% every five years as the base expands. Under the standard model, we anticipate an average annual EV sales growth of 20%, spiraling from 26.2 million in 2022 to 582 million in 2040. This projection accounts for current EV data and auto industry strategies, especially in high-growth markets like China and India. This table shows the fuel-saving projections from 2016 to 2023:  Comparing Forecasts:

 ADVERTISEMENT This table contrasts the EV and fuel-saving projections from 2016 with those of 2023:  In our updated study: Forecasting based on alternative scenarios suggests that our projections will most likely fall between the reference and high-case scenarios. Given this, the ascendancy of the EV industry seems poised to command a significant portion of the future internal combustion engine (ICE) market. Considering the ever-changing landscape of both the oil and automotive industries, it's prudent to reassess our assumptions every five years. Factors like updated data, evolving consumer preferences, and automotive industry strategies should be weighed in these evaluations. Looking towards 2040, one pivotal question emerges: How will the projected penetration of EVs and consequent fuel displacement impact the global oil sector? If fuel displacement aligns with our reference to high-case scenarios, it could ring alarm bells for the global oil and gas industry. This is especially true for nations heavily reliant on oil export revenues. While these analyses serve as early warnings, they also offer the oil industry ample time to strategize. By 2040, even with the rise of EVs, global oil demand may still hover between 65-78 MMBD, a decline from 100 MMBD in 2022. As a result, intense competition for market share might lead to price wars. In such scenarios, ICE vehicle owners and other industrial consumers stand to benefit the most.",Negative
Oil Majors Eye Higher Shale Output This Year.html,"The latest earnings season saw several shale oil majors revise their output projections for the year. Surprisingly, they revised these projections upward.  The revisions were attributed to higher well productivity that Bloomberg said in a recent report had come as a surprise. Thanks to that surprise, U.S. oil production was set for stronger than previously expected growth this year.


 Or maybe not, if we are to believe analysts that Reuters polled on their take on the U.S. shale industry. According to these analysts, it would take more than a surprise reversal in well productivity trends to boost U.S. shale oil production meaningfully. The “surprise” increase in well productivity may have been unexpected for the media, but it certainly wasn’t totally unexpected for the industry. The reason: those companies that reported such productivity improvements said they’d been working at improving their drilling efficiency. And they’ve seen results. Pioneer Natural Resources, whose CEO Scott Sheffield last year warned that the shale boom is over, citing, among other things, well productivity, has now boasted higher yields thanks to longer well laterals. Chevron reported record output for the second quarter as it focused on the Texas part of the Permian rather than the New Mexico side. The company expects 10% higher production from the Permian this year. Yet the analysts polled by Reuters argue that this will not be enough to boost total U.S. output significantly, not at the current drilling rates, which remain subdued.  Related: OPEC: Robust Demand, U.S. Hurricane Season Could Tighten The Market Oilfield services providers sounded the alarm last month. They said demand for these services in the shale patch was on the decline, with all three supermajors in the space—SLB, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes—reporting a decline in business for North America. “During the second quarter, we saw reduced frack activity that resulted in increased white space in our calendar,” Chris Wright, the chief executive of fracking major Liberty Energy, told the FT. Wright also said the company might need to reduce the number of its fracking fleet going forward if demand remained at the same level.


 So, on the one hand, exploration and production companies are reporting higher well productivity rates while their oilfield service providers are reporting lower drilling activity. Meanwhile, the EIA revised up its projection for this year’s U.S. oil total to a record 12.8 million bpd, up from an earlier forecast of 12.6 million bpd. Per EIA estimates, last week saw production hitting 12.6 million bpd already. The industry itself appears to estimate the annual boost in production at 850,000 bpd, thanks to these longer laterals and lower drilling costs. The EIA also cites higher oil prices as drivers of higher production. Yet analysts note the fast depletion rates of shale wells, noting that it would take a lot more active drilling to offset this natural process and boost production considerably at the same time. But shale majors are not doing this. They remain disciplined despite higher prices. What all that suggests is that however high U.S. output goes this year, it is not very likely it would go high enough to put significant pressure on international prices, not least because of the record rate of U.S. oil exports.

 ADVERTISEMENT These exports are putting downward pressure on benchmarks but, once again, it has its limits: Saudi Arabia remains a much bigger exporter of crude than the U.S., and so does Russia, and both have put caps on either production or exports. Saudi Arabia has also warned it could go a step further and deepen its production cuts to keep prices higher. This is good news for shale drillers. It gives them the opportunity to spend less, pump more, and make more money by selling that higher output abroad thanks to robust and resilient demand in Russia’s former biggest market – Europe – as well as the world’s biggest market for oil, Asia.",Positive
The Looming Oil Crisis The World Is Ignoring.html,"It has recently become clear to me that heavy oil, which is needed to produce diesel and jet fuel, plays a far more significant role in the world economy than most people understand. We need heavy oil that can be extracted, processed, and transported inexpensively to be able to provide the category of fuels sometimes referred to as Middle Distillates if our modern economy is to continue. A transition to electricity doesn’t work for most heavy equipment that is powered by diesel or jet fuel. A major concern is that the physics of our self-organizing economy plays an important role in determining what actually happens. Leaders may think that they are in charge, but their power to change the way the overall system works, in the chosen direction, is quite limited. The physics of the system tends to keep oil prices lower than heavy oil producers would prefer. It tends to cause debt bubbles to collapse. It tends to squeeze out “inefficient” uses of oil from the system in ways we wouldn’t expect. In the future, the physics of the system may keep parts of the world economy operating while other inefficient pieces get squeezed out.


 In this post, I will try to explain some of the issues with oil limits as they seem to be playing out, particularly as they apply to diesel and jet fuel, the major components of Middle Distillates. As I frequently point out, the world economy is a physics-based system. World oil prices are set by supply and demand. Demand is quite closely tied to what people around the world can afford to pay for food and for transportation services because the use of oil is integral to today’s food production and transportation services. Heavy oil is especially involved in this affordability issue. As oil becomes “heavier,” it becomes more viscous, and thus more difficult to ship by pipeline. If oil is very heavy, as is the oil from the Oil Sands of Canada, it needs to be mixed with an appropriate diluent to be shipped by pipeline. Heavy oil often has sulfur and other pollutants mixed in, adding costs to the refining process. Furthermore, heavy oil, especially very heavy oil, often needs to be “cracked” in a refinery to provide a desirable mix of end products, including diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline. This, too, adds costs. Otherwise, there would be too much of the product mix that would be like asphalt. Also, as noted previously, even if the costs of production are high, the selling price of diesel cannot rise very high without raising food prices. This tends to keep the prices of heavy crude oils below those for lighter crude oils. Many people believe that the high level of “Proved Oil Reserves” worldwide makes it certain that businesses can extract as much oil as they would like in the future. A major issue is whether these reserves mean as much as people assume they do. Oil reserves of OECD countries (an association of the US and other rich countries) are likely to be audited, but reserves of other countries may not be. Asking a relatively poor oil-exporting country the amount of its oil reserves is like asking the country how wealthy it is. We should not be surprised by fibbing on the high side. The problem is that the vast majority of reported oil reserves (85%) are held by non-OECD countries. These reserves may be significantly overstated. Also, even if the reserves are fairly reported, will the country have the resources to extract these reserves? Venezuela reports the highest oil reserves in the world thanks to its heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt, but it extracts a relatively small amount per year. An October 2022 article says that the country is waiting for foreign investment to expand production. Going forward, oil companies everywhere need to worry about broken supply lines for necessary items, such as steel drilling pipe. They need to worry about finding enough trained workers. They need to worry about the availability of debt and the interest rate that will be charged for this debt. If private oil companies look at the true prospects and find them too bleak, they will likely use their profits to buy back the shares of their own oil companies instead (as is happening now). It is easy for people to assume that any part of the oil mix is substitutable for another part, but this is not true. Cracking long hydrocarbon chains works to make shorter chains, but the economics tend not to work in the other direction. Thus, it is not economically feasible to make gasoline into diesel (which is heavier), or natural gas liquids into diesel. If there is not enough oil to go around, some users must be left out. The result is that some of the less profitable consumers of oil may file for bankruptcy. For example, the Wall Street Journal recently reported Trucking Giant Yellow Shuts Down Operations. This bankruptcy makes it impossible for some stores to get the merchandise that would normally be on their shelves. As a consequence, it makes it likely that some replacement parts for automobiles will not be available when needed. There is a workaround of renting another vehicle while a person’s car is waiting for repairs, but this adds to total costs. This workaround illustrates how a lack of adequate oil can indirectly lead to higher overall costs, even if the oil itself is not higher-priced. The need to work around supply line problems tends to lead to inflation in the prices of goods that continue to be available. In 1957, Hyman Rickover of the US navy predicted that the amount of affordable fossil fuels would fall short between 2000 and 2050, with the amount of oil falling short earlier than coal and natural gas. The book The Limits to Growth by Donella Meadows and others, published in 1972, discusses the result of early modeling efforts with respect to resource limits. These resource limits were very broadly defined, including minerals such as copper and lithium in addition to fossil fuels. A range of indications were produced, but the base model (based on business as usual) seemed to show limits hitting before 2030 (Figure 1). Since the resource limits include minerals of all types, these limits would seem to preclude a transition to clean energy and electric cars. Educators, advertisers, and political leaders could see that discussing the oil problem would cause economic suicide. What would be the point of buying a car, if a person couldn’t use it for very long? Educators felt that students needed to be guided in the direction of hoped-for solutions, no matter how remote they might be, if university programs were to remain open. Politicians and government officials wanted to keep voters happy, so the self-organizing economy pushed them in the direction of keeping the story from the public. They tended to focus on climate issues instead. They added biofuels to stretch the supply of gasoline, and to a lesser extent, diesel. They also increased the share of natural gas liquids. The selling price of these liquids tends to be quite low, relative to the price of crude oil. They started providing reports showing “all liquids” rather than “crude oil,” in the hope that people wouldn’t notice the change in mix. Diesel and jet fuel provide the big bursts of power that commercial equipment requires. Many types of equipment are dependent on Middle Distillates, including semi-trucks, agricultural equipment, ocean-going ships, jet planes, road-making equipment, school buses, and trains operating in areas with steep inclines. Because of its concentrated store of energy, diesel is also used to operate backup generators and to provide electricity in remote areas of the world where it would be impractical to have year-round electricity without an easily stored fuel. In Figure 3: Until recently, it has been possible to increase diesel production by refining an added share of Fuel Oil. Fuel oil is quite heavy (barely a liquid), so it is well-suited to be refined into a mix that includes a large share of Middle Distillates.


 Now we are running short of Fuel Oil to refine for the purpose of producing more Middle Distillates. The Fuel Oil that is still consumed is used in what I think of as the poorer countries of the world: the non-OECD countries (Figure 4). Poor countries tend to value “low price” over “prevents pollution.” It is likely to be difficult to get these countries to move away from the use of Fuel Oil. Figure 5 shows that since about 1983, consumption per capita for both Light Distillates and Middle Distillates has been generally slightly growing. Growth in usage tends to be higher for Middle Distillates than Light Distillates. The total quantity consumed is also higher for Middle Distillates. The dip in consumption per capita in 2020 is much more pronounced for Middle Distillates than Light Distillates. For Middle Distillates, the change from 2018 to 2020 is -16%; the change from 2018 to 2022 is -7%. The corresponding changes for Light Distillates are -11% and -4%. The difference in patterns in Light Distillates and Middle Distillates is not surprising: Gasoline, the main product of Light Distillates, has been the focus of efficiency changes. It is also possible to dilute gasoline with ethanol, made from corn. Voters in the US are particularly aware of gasoline availability and price, so politicians tend to focus on it. Diesel and jet fuel, made using Middle Distillates, are less on the minds of voters, but they are probably more important to the economy because people’s jobs depend upon the economy in its current form holding together. Inadequate Middle Distillates leaves empty shelves in stores because of broken supply lines. It also leads to inflation of the type we have recently been experiencing. Indirectly, lack of Middle Distillates can lead to debt bubbles collapsing, and to problems of a different type than inflation. Up until 2007, Middle Distillate consumption was generally increasing for both OECD countries and non-OECD countries. The Great Recession of 2008-2009 particularly affected OECD countries. European countries found their economies doing less well. For example, less diesel was used to operate tour boats carrying tourists; a larger share of available jobs were low-paid service jobs. The year 2013 was a turning point of a different type. The consumption of non-OECD countries caught up with that of OECD countries. While non-OECD countries might like to maintain their rapid upward trajectory in the consumption of Middle Distillates, this no longer seems to be possible. The economy, like every other ecosystem, operates under the principle of “survival of the best adapted.” In terms of the sale of goods, this means that the lowest-priced goods will tend to win out in a competitive environment, provided that they are of adequate quality and that the makers can earn an adequate profit in making them. Furthermore, the makers of the goods must earn a high enough profit both for reinvestment and to pay adequate taxes to their governments. Payments of taxes to governments are essential; otherwise governmental collapse would occur due to the growing debt that cannot be repaid. If inflation becomes a problem, rising interest rates would tend to push governments with large amounts of debt toward collapse because they would become unable even to make interest payments from current income. In this self-organizing economy, buyers of goods don’t know or care much about the lives of the workers in the system. Optimal low costs of manufacturing in a world market might mean: Because the economy favors the lowest cost of profitable production, a person would expect that warm countries that use oil sparingly in their energy mix (India, the Philippines, and Vietnam, for example) would have a competitive edge over other countries in manufacturing. In general, a person would expect non-OECD countries to outcompete OECD countries, especially if cheap fuel for manufacturing is available. The lack of cheap fuel is increasingly becoming a problem in many parts of the world. Coal used to be cheap, but its price can now spike. Natural gas prices can also spike, especially if natural gas is purchased without a long-term contract. Electricity using wind and solar tends to be high-priced, too, when the cost of transmission is included. The EU has a serious oil problem. It has essentially no crude oil production of its own. Furthermore, oil production in Europe outside of the EU (mainly the UK and Norway) has been falling since 1999, greatly reducing the possibility of imported oil from this area (Figure 7). Under these circumstances, members of the EU found that they needed to import nearly all of their oil, and that most of this oil needed to come from outside Europe. When I look at the data regarding the types of oil the EU has chosen to consume (nearly all imported), I find that it uses an oil mix that is unusually skewed toward Middle Distillates and away from Light Distillates. (Compare Figure 8 with Figure 3).
ADVERTISEMENT



 ADVERTISEMENT Part of the reason the EU uses this skewed oil mix is because it has encouraged the use of private passenger cars using diesel through its tax structure. Underlying this tax structure was most likely an understanding that Russia, through its exports of Urals Oil, which is heavy, could provide the EU with the mix of oil products it needed, including extra diesel. The EU has recently cut off most oil imports from Russia as a way of punishing Russia. This cutoff is being phased in, with most of the impact in 2023 and later. Thus, Figure 8 (which is through 2022) shouldn’t be much affected. China and India are now buying most of Russia’s exported oil. These countries tend to use the oil more “efficiently” than the EU. In particular, they do more manufacturing than the EU, and they have far fewer private passenger cars per capita than the EU. Furthermore, the EU powers quite a few of its private passenger cars with diesel. If diesel is in short supply, efficiency demands that it should be saved for uses that require it, such as powering heavy equipment. Because of the efficiency issue, I doubt that the EU will be able to continue importing as high a diesel mix in the future as it has been importing up to now. We know that Saudi Arabia cut back its oil exports by 1 million barrels per day, as of July 1, and this cutback is continuing into August. Russia is also cutting its production by 500,000 barrels a day, effective August 1. If oil prices rise again, I wonder whether the EU will be forced to cut back on its oil imports, essentially because of the Maximum Power Principle. Middle Distillates are largely used for the tough jobs–jobs that require big bursts of power. Electricity and the battery storage required for electricity are not adapted to these tough jobs. The vehicles become too heavy, especially when the big battery packs that would be required are considered. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that battery-powered commercial trucks can cost more than three times the price of diesel-powered trucks, a hurdle much smaller private passenger automobiles don’t face. The wide diversity of types of heavy commercial vehicles would be another huge hurdle in trying to substitute electricity for diesel. Oil is a mixture of different hydrocarbon lengths. Substitution of electricity for one part of the hydrocarbon mix, namely for the Light Distillates, is not very helpful. Oil companies need to be able to sell all parts of the mix in order to make their extraction efforts worthwhile. If oil companies find themselves without buyers for most Light Distillates, they would have difficulty recouping their overall costs. There would be a possibility of oil production stopping. Without oil, farming would mostly stop. Road repair would stop. Today’s economy would come to a halt. Of course, as a practical matter, the vast majority of the world will pay no attention to mandates that all private passenger automobiles be EVs. Buyers in most parts of the world will make decisions based on which cars are least expensive to own and operate. As a result, there is little chance of private passenger cars being completely replaced by EVs. Instead, EV mandates in some countries may somewhat reduce the selling price of gasoline worldwide because these drivers are no longer using gasoline. With lower gasoline prices, non-EV’s are likely to become cheaper to operate in countries where they are permitted, boosting their sales. This is an effect similar to Jevons Paradox. A few of samples of other issues: [a] The world economy is tightly networked together. Inadequate oil supplies per capita tend to push the economy toward forced reduced activity, as was the case in 2020. Oil prices likely won’t rise a whole lot higher, for very long, if the economy is forced to shrink. [b] Inadequate oil supplies per capita also tend to cause fighting among countries. OECD countries seem to over consume, relative to the benefits they provide to the rest of the world. Perhaps some grouping of non-OECD countries (or parts of countries) will take over in leadership roles. [c] The self-organizing economy has different priorities than human leaders. All ecosystems in a finite world go through cycles. As conditions change, different species are favored, and new species emerge. Humans have a strong preference for recent conditions that helped humans thrive. Humans need a religion to follow, so leaders have created environmental sin to replace original sin. The catch is that ecosystems are built for change. Pollution can be viewed as a type of fertilizer for different types of species or recent mutations to thrive. Higher temperatures will have a net favorable effect for some organisms. [d] If a local economy chooses to increase energy costs by taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, the main impact may be to disadvantage the local economy relative to the world economy. If total energy costs are higher, the cost of finished goods and services is likely to be higher, making the economy less competitive. [e] I expect that the members of the EU and other rich nations will be the primary countries pursuing carbon reduction technologies. Poorer economies may pay lip service to carbon reduction, but they will tend to focus primarily on increasing the welfare of their own people, whether or not this requires more carbon. For example, in 2022, China accounted for 66% of global EV sales (5.0 million out of 7.7 million), thanks to subsidies that China made available. China no doubt had many motives, but one of them would seem to be to stimulate the economy. Another motive would be to increase the total number of vehicles in operation. The majority (61%) of electricity generation in China in 2022 was provided by electricity coming from coal-fired power plants, based on information from the Energy Institute. I would expect that more Chinese vehicles manufactured and placed into operation plus more use of electricity from coal would lead to a greater quantity of carbon emissions, rather than a smaller quantity.",Positive
Petros Plan To End Oil Exploration Threatens Colombias Energy Security.html,"Colombia’s beaten-down oil industry is struggling to recover from the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, with the tempo of operations and production lower than in 2019. The 2022 electoral victory of former guerilla and senator Gustavo Petro which saw him become Colombia’s first leftwing President, cast a cloud of uncertainty over the hydrocarbon sector’s future. Petro, as part of transitioning Colombia to cleaner renewable forms of energy, plans to end contracting for hydrocarbon exploration in the Andean country and ban hydraulic fracturing. This will threaten Colombia’s energy security and economic well-being because of the strife-torn country’s dependence on fossil fuels for exports and government revenue. Even after two years, Colombia’s oil industry has been unable to return to overcome the 2020 pandemic and return to a pre-pandemic tempo of operations. For May 2023, the petroleum-dependent country lifted an average of 773,789 barrels per day, which was 1% lower than a month earlier but 3.6% higher year over. Despite that solid year-over-year growth, the May 2023 production volume was still significantly lower, by 13.5%, than the 894,519 barrels per day pumped for the same month during 2019, indicating production has not returned to pre-pandemic volumes. Natural gas output has also yet to recover, which is creating considerable consternation in a country already facing shortages and a potential natural gas crisis. July 2023, natural gas output of 1.1 billion cubic feet per day, while nearly 4% higher than a month earlier, was 4% less than for the same period in 2023 and lower than in 2019.


 There are a range of reasons for this, the key is a sharp drop of investment in Colombia’s energy patch. The Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP – Spanish initials) earlier this year stated investment by private oil companies in exploration will plunge 33% year over year to $700 million. Ecopetrol’s decision to substantially boost spending on upstream operations in Colombia during 2023 will compensate for the significant reduction in spending on exploration activities by private drillers. For that reason, the total annual investment in hydrocarbon exploration in Colombia during 2023 will only decline by 4% to $1.24 billion. Overall, 2023 investment in the Andean country’s energy patch is forecast by the ACP to be just over $5 billion, with $3.81 million, or 75% of total capital spending, to be directed to production and development activities, representing a 6% increase year over year. The decision by private oil companies to significantly slash capital spending during 2023 can be blamed on Petro hiking industry taxes during November 2022 and his plans to cease awarding new contracts for oil exploration. Those strategies form a key plank in Petro’s plan to wean Colombia off its fossil fuel dependence, with oil responsible for 29% of Colombia’s exports by value for the first six months of 2023 and accelerate the country’s transition to renewable sources of energy. Since the late 1990s, petroleum has been a crucial economic driver for Colombia, with it eventually becoming the largest legal export by value and an important source of government income.  Heightened insecurity, frequent anti-oil industry protests, the latest against Sinopec-owned Emerald Energy in Caqueta Department, a deteriorating social license and elevated geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on Colombia's hydrocarbon sector. The negative impact of these events is magnified by the scandals embroiling Petro’s administration and even the president himself, with his son Nicolas Petro arrested and charged with money laundering. During July 2023, allegations of misconduct claimed the scalp of Petro’s energy minister Irene Velez. These purported wrongdoings make it near-impossible for the president to gain the necessary support in Congress to implement his proposed reforms, including ending hydrocarbon exploration, seeing Petro’s activist agenda grind to a halt.  These events are not only preventing oil production from returning to pre-pandemic levels but are responsible for a decline in vital drilling activity. Despite the ACP predicting that 55 to 60 exploration wells will be drilled this year data from Colombia’s hydrocarbon regulator (Spanish), the National Hydrocarbon Authority (ANH – Spanish initials) shows only 28 wildcat wells were completed during the first five months of 2023. The data, thus far, indicates that a substantially lower number of exploration wells will be completed during 2023 when compared to 2022, when 68 were drilled. The latest Baker Hughes International Rig Count indicates drilling activity is in decline. During July 2023, there were only 24 active drill rigs in Colombia compared to 35 at the end of December 2022 and 33 for the same month a year earlier.


 Declining investment and drilling activity will weigh on Colombia’s hydrocarbon production, and it is already being felt as production data shows with current output is less than was reported for 2019. This highlights the considerable risks posed by Petro’s plan to end hydrocarbon exploration in a country that economically depends on petroleum exports yet possesses limited proven reserves with no major oil discoveries in over a decade. There are fears the president’s policy will endanger Colombia’s energy security, especially with a natural gas shortage looming. By ending oil exploration, the ACP believes there will be a need to substantially boost natural gas imports and that Colombia, which is a net oil exporter, will be forced to start importing petroleum by as early as 2028. This will place considerable pressure on a fiscally weak Bogota, where oil is responsible for up to a fifth of government revenue.",Positive
Saudi Arabia Could Deepen Production Cuts As Chinas Oil Imports Fall.html,"Last month, several commodity experts predicted the Saudis will prolong its voluntary production cut but taper off their extra cut by restoring 250,000-500,000 barrels a day of halted production in September. A week later, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) published confirmation that the country will indeed extend its 1 million barrels per day (mb/d) oil output cut into September, but with an important nuance that was largely missed by much of the media coverage that the cut “can be extended or extended and deepened”. This marks the first time Saudi Arabia has signaled a willingness to make even deeper cuts if the previous ones are taking too long to achieve the desired effect. The first cuts certainly appear to have worked, with Brent prices climbing ~12% in the past month to a four-month high of $87.61 in Wednesday's intraday session. Still, current oil prices might be too low for Saudi Arabia since it needs $100-a-barrel crude to balance its books.


 Weakening demand by major oil consumers might also persuade Saudi Arabia to cut even further. The latest data coming from China shows that crude oil imports fell 2.412mb/d m/m to a sixth-month low of 10.429mb/d as stockpiling wanes. It’s not clear if this is the beginning of a downtrend since June’s imports were the second highest on record as inventory building hit a torrid clip. To be fair, the y/y increase in crude oil imports in July was a hefty 1.519mb/d, 17% higher than the volume a year ago.  Related: European Gas Prices Surge 30% On Australian Supply Fears Meanwhile, India’s oil demand for the month of July clocked in at 4.70mb/d, weaker than Wall Street’s expectations of 4.83mb/d. The country’s pace of y/y demand growth slowed from 190 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) in June to 84kb/d in July. The data here again is mixed because gasoline demand growth increased to 6.3% in July from 6.2% in June while diesel demand growth increased to 3.9% from 3.1%. To Cut Or Not To Cut Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have wagered that Saudi Arabia will not deepen its cuts because crude inventories are likely to fall sharply going forward. But the EIA appears to be less optimistic. The agency estimates that the call on OPEC crude will average 28.1mb/d in H2, 1.4mb/d less than StanChart’s model; 2.0mb/d less than the International Energy Agency (IEA) model and 2.3mb/d less than the OPEC Secretariat model. StanChart has predicted large deficits in August and September but zero surpluses until the seasonal demand falls in January whereas EIA has predicted several surpluses during that period. The analysts have opined that Saudi Arabia might decide to wait till the statistical fog clears before deciding whether or not to deepen its production cuts. 


 Source: Standard Chartered Research Tightening Oil Markets Most energy experts have predicted that global oil markets will gradually tighten, which should boost prices as the months roll on. The International Energy Agency(IEA) in Paris has predicted an oil shortage of about 1.7 million barrels a day during the second half of the year. Commodity experts at Standard Chartered have predicted that global oil markets will register a supply deficit of 2.81 million barrels per day in August; 2.43mb/d in September and more than 2mb/d in November and December. The analysts have also projected that global inventories will fall by 310mb by end-2023 and another 94mb in the first quarter of 2024 thus pushing oil prices higher. According to the experts, Brent prices will climb to $93/bbl in the fourth quarter. The natural gas market is, perhaps, even harder to predict right now because prices are flying despite fundamentals remaining weak and supply plentiful. European natural gas prices rocketed more than 30% on Wednesday, as traders panicked over the possibility of reduced LNG supply from Australia, the world leading supplier of the commodity. The European benchmark, TFF, jumped to as high as €42 per megawatt hour in Wednesday intraday trading, 35% higher than the previous day, and its highest point since mid-June.

 ADVERTISEMENT EU natural gas inventories, however, have continued rising at a record clip, moving above 100 billion cubic meters (bcm) on 2 August for the first time this injection season. According to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), inventories stood at 101.3bcm on 6th August, a good 87.4% of maximum fill. The average rate of refill over the past week, however, slowed to 308 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d) from 339 mcm/d the previous week, still nearly 90% of the five-year average rate.

Oil Ticks Higher On Fuel Inventory Draws.html,"Crude oil prices moved higher today after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported an estimated inventory build of 5.9 million barrels for the week to August 4. Fuel inventories, however, moved lower.


 The crude build compared with a substantial inventory decline of 17 million barrels for the previous week—the largest drawdown in oil inventories for years. The report comes a day after the American Petroleum Institute estimated oil inventories had added a little over 4 million barrels over last week. In fuels, the EIA estimated substantial inventory declines for the week to August 4. Gasoline inventories shed 2.7 million barrels during the week to August 4, which compared with a build of 1.5 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 9.9 million bpd last week, which compared with 9.8 million bpd a week earlier. In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 1.7 million barrels for the week to August 4, which compared with a draw of 800,000 barrels for the previous week.


 Middle distillate production averaged 4.9 million bpd last week, which compared with 4.9 million bpd a week earlier. Oil prices have stabilized, meanwhile, as the upward potential was capped by fresh CPI data from China showing the first annual decline since February 2021, according to Reuters. The report followed another, revealing that China’s oil imports had fallen by close to 20% in July from June, when they hit a record high. The data seems to have worried traders about the resilience of demand in the world’s top importer. There is also concern about demand for oil in Europe and the United States amid a series of rate hikes aimed at reining in inflation but making life more expensive in the process.

Venezuelas Oil Industry Is Killing South Americas Oldest Lake.html,"Lake Maracaibo, which is South America’s oldest lake and forms part of a crucial regional ecosystem, is dying. The five thousand square miles ecologically diverse body of water, which is home to 145 species of fish, sits at the heart of one of the world’s richest petroleum-producing regions. The lake formed around 36 million years ago and is considered the largest natural lake in South America despite being connected to the Caribbean Sea. Over a century of oil production in Venezuela’s prolific 25,000 square mile Maracaibo Basin, where over 30 billion barrels of crude oil have been lifted, has left Lake Maracaibo heavily polluted. Thin films of oil and algae blooms frequently coat the lake’s surface, while petroleum slicks are regular occurrences. Due to the magnitude of pollution, which intensified after Hugo Chavez launched his 1999 socialist Bolivarian revolution, the damage now appears irreversible.  Lake Maracaibo is situated near the center of the Maracaibo Basin. The first petroleum discovery in the geological body was made in 1914 at the town of Mene Grande, which was followed by Royal Dutch Shell discovering the La Rosa oilfield in 1922. By 1928 commercial oil deposits under Lake Maracaibo had been identified. It is estimated that the Maracaibo Basin contains a fifth of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, which at 303 billion barrels, are the world’s largest and responsible for roughly two-thirds of the crisis-torn country’s petroleum production. Estimates vary, but it is believed there are up to 44 billion barrels of crude oil contained in the geological body which have yet to be discovered.


 There are reputedly more than 10,000 oil-related installations dotted around Lake Maracaibo and along with thousands of miles of petroleum industry pipelines crisscrossing the body of water. Much, if not all, of that aging energy industry infrastructure, including pipelines, storage tanks and derricks, has fallen into disrepair, leaving it heavily corroded and steadily leaking crude oil into the lake. According to a 2021 North American Space Agency (NASA) report, most of the crude oil entering Lake Maracaibo is coming from a vast network of aging submerged pipelines that have fallen into disrepair and are not even mapped. Oil spills are also coming from above-ground storage tanks, drilling platforms and transportation vessels. The situation is so severe that in June 2023, the Venezuelan environmental group, the Blue Environmentalists Foundation, known in Spanish as Fundación Azul Ambientalistas (Spanish), warned of a state of emergency at Lake Maracaibo. According to the conservation group, founded in 1986 at the University of Zulia in Maracaibo, oil slicks are responsible for the widespread death of marine wildlife in what was once a highly biodiverse body of water. For years, local fishermen who make their living from Lake Maracaibo have complained of a persistent black sludge coating their boats, equipment, clothing and catches. At the end of each workday, those fishermen not only have to clean oil from there but are forced to use raw gasoline to remove the oil sludge from their hands and equipment, leaving them with prickly rashes. Crude oil oozing into Lake Maracaibo from rickety and heavily corroded infrastructure isn’t the only problem. An array of frequent algae and duckweed blooms are also choking the lake causing oxygen levels to fall and killing marine life. In the latest development, a thick greenish film, known locally as verdin, is coating up to 70% of Lake Maracaibo (Spanish). This is the result of a photosynthetic organism, cyanobacteria which is tolerant to oil and is feeding on excess nutrients in Lake Maracaibo. The film prevents light from entering the lake’s waters, creating an aquatic greenhouse effect. This, along with the organism emitting a toxin, is killing whatever marine life is left in Lake Maracaibo. The verdin outbreak saw the Blue Environmentalist Foundation declare that the water body’s ecology is collapsing (Spanish) with claims that a combination of the verdin and frequent oil spills has led to parts of the estuary being filled with dead zones that have no marine life. The frequency of oil spills in and around Lake Maracaibo is only growing as the autocratic Maduro regime desperately seeks to squeeze every barrel of oil out of operational assets. The Venezuelan Observatory of Environmental Human Rights (OVDHA) estimated in a 2022 report that 1,000 barrels of oil per day are being discharged into Lake Maracaibo. The Observatory of Political Ecology of Venezuela counted 86 oil spills across the country during 2022 (Spanish) compared to 77 a year earlier. More than a third of those 2022 spills, 31 in total, occurred in the state of Zulia in or around Lake Maracaibo. A member of the observatory Elsa Rodriguez, said, “There are more and more reports of spills,.” She then went on to say that many spills go unreported, which along with national oil company PDVSA refusing to provide official data and Carcas’ failure to acknowledge spills, makes it impossible to quantify the true scale of the catastrophe.


 The rising volume of oil oozing into Lake Maracaibo has paralyzed the local fishing and tourism industries from which local communities eke a living. This is destroying what is left of the local economy in a country suffering from a deep and long-running economic crisis. The ongoing leakage of crude oil into Lake Maracaibo, combined with a dearth of clean-up efforts, means that after more than two decades, the damage could very well be irreversible. The latest announcement from Maduro that he has allocated resources to clean-up efforts and created a special plan of attention (Spanish) for the recovery of Lake Maracaibo underscores the gravity of the situation. Nonetheless, it is too little too late in a country where a dictatorial regime is determined to pump as much crude oil as possible regardless of the degradation that occurs. This is aggravating the already colossal environmental catastrophe underway in Venezuela. ",Positive

How AI Is Breathing New Life Into Oil And Gas Operations.html,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies in the oil and gas industry has increased dramatically in recent years and is expected to continue growing over the coming decades. Modernisation and digitalisation were already starting to be welcomed by the oil and gas industry, but the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions drove an acceleration in the adoption of a range of new technologies, which has since continued. AI is now viewed as a game changer for the oil and gas industry, used to reduce operational costs, improve sustainability, and speed up processes. According to market research carried out by Mordor Intelligence, the use of AI in the oil and gas market is expected to increase at a CAGR of 10.81 percent between 2022 and 2027. And a recent Ernst & Young survey showed that 92 percent of oil and gas companies around the globe are investing in AI or have plans to do so within the next 5 years. 


 Despite the accelerated adoption of AI technologies, the rate at which companies are adopting AI remains slower than the speed at which it's being developed and applied in other sectors. Kumar Lakshmipathi, principal solutions architect for Amazon Web Services, explained “In the energy sector, we’re not seeing adoption as we should… Compared to other industries, this is not what we see.”  AI could be applied in a variety of ways in the oil and gas industry, such as to monitor and improve safety, increase operational performance, or provide insights and forecasts. The use of AI could significantly improve supply chain management, with the potential to reduce errors by between 20 and 50 percent. This is seen as increasingly important following the supply chain disruptions during and following the Covid pandemic. The delays in the manufacturing and delivery of energy components created a significant backlog in the industry, with many operations experiencing cost and time increases. Using AI to manage supply chain systems could help to alleviate these pressures in the future.  New AI technologies can also dramatically help to improve safety standards, enhancing company ESG practices and potentially preventing disasters. Better monitoring of oil and gas platforms could help to improve worker safety, further mitigating the chance of health and safety issues. This technology can also be used for the monitoring of pipelines and other infrastructure to prevent leaks and oil spills. This could help companies save millions in losses as well as avoid major damage to the environment.  To date, some of the leading energy companies in AI adoption include Shell, BP, and ExxonMobil. Shell has introduced AI technologies across its whole oil and gas supply chain, with more than 160 active projects by May this year. It has used these technologies to reduce gas extraction costs and automate drilling systems to help drill operators better understand the environment. It has also introduced the Shell AI Residency Programme to give data scientists and AI engineers experience with a range of AI projects at Shell. The oil major is also using AI technology in its renewable energy operations, to predict the varying demand for EV charging stations through the day to supply power appropriately.   Meanwhile, ExxonMobil is using AI to assess the viability of a region for drilling. In its recent Guyana operations, the firm used closed-loop automation, which controls the drilling process without human intervention. The use of this technology has allowed rig workers to shift their attention to other important tasks, helping to reduce the need for engineers to carry out repetitive tasks that can be managed by machines. Exxon is also using AI in its Permian basin operations in the U.S. to improve efficiency. 


 And the British oil major BP has partnered with Microsoft since 2017 to implement its Azure cloud solutions to improve drilling processes, leading to a reduction in drilling time. BP has since partnered with Bluware to use deep learning to enhance subsurface data interpretation by eliminating manual, time-consuming interpretation of seismic data. The firm also recently invested $5 million in the start-up Belmont Technology’s Series A financing to improve the company’s AI and digital capabilities in its Upstream business. This follows a wide range of other investments in AI companies to enhance decision-making. BP has also trialled the AI-driven Spot robot at one of its refineries, using the robot to gather data, detect abnormalities and emissions, and take workers out of potentially hazardous situations.  Innovative digital technologies, such as AI, are becoming vital to the running of oil and gas operations, used to reduce times and costs as well as to enhance worker and environmental safety. More companies, big and small, are now open to adopting AI technology, particularly following the challenges faced during the Covid pandemic. However, the rollout of the most up-to-date AI technology is still lacking in the energy sector, with significant room for improvement.

From Unknown To Unstoppable New Traders Redefine Russias Oil Landscape.html,"Little-known and newly-incorporated trading companies have handled large volumes of Russian crude oil and products since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the withdrawal of Western firms from trades with Russia’s oil.  The little-known oil trading companies that have mushroomed are incorporated in jurisdictions outside of Europe and are often notoriously opaque in their management and dealings.  


 Some of those companies are said to have some representatives in common, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.  Two of the new large traders of Russian crude and refined petroleum products – Coral Energy and Nord Axis Ltd – have had representatives in common. One representative for Coral Energy and a lawyer who has done work for Coral have both been directors of Nord Axis, per the documents dated 2022 Bloomberg has reviewed.  Nord Axis is not as unknown as many other oil traders that have sprung up and started trading Russia’s oil. Nord Axis, a Hong Kong-registered trading company, acquired the 10 percent non-operational, passive shareholding of oil trading giant Trafigura in the Vostok Oil project last year. Back then, Western majors were quitting en masse operations and non-operational stakes in Russian energy projects.  Nord Axis is now a major exporter of Russian crude and handled as much as 586,000 barrels per day (bpd) worth $3.66 billion in the first four months of 2023, per data from the Kyiv School of Economics’ KSE Institute cited by Bloomberg. Nord Axis also traded $2.19 billion worth of refined products in the first four months of the year. Coral Energy, for its part, has seen its trade in Russian oil plunge this year, after saying in February that it was no longer trading any Russian crude or products.  According to KSE Institute’s study on the sanctions on Russian oil, Russia continues to earn around $425 million per day from oil exports.  “These inflows of foreign exchange play a key role for overall macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, revenues from oil production and exports help Russia to pay for the war,” the authors of the July 2023 report from the Kyiv School of Economics said, calling for much lower price caps on Russian crude oil and refined products. 


 Russian customs data cited by Bloomberg has recently shown that the little-known newly-set up oil trading firms are handling a large part of the Russian oil supply to the market. Nord Axis Ltd, Tejarinaft FZCO, QR Trading DMCC, Concept Oil Services Ltd, Bellatrix Energy Ltd, and Coral Energy DMCC together handled about 1.4 million bpd of Russian crude oil. That’s more oil than what the commodity giants typically handled before the war in Ukraine and enough to meet the entire needs of countries such as the UK and Italy.  Newly established commodity trading firms incorporated in Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have replaced trading and oil giants in handling Russian crude oil and products after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the EU and G7 sanctions and price caps that followed.   By some estimates, these one-year-old or younger trading companies have shipped at least half of all the Russian crude and refined products exports so far this year.  The business of transporting Russian crude to Asia has become “crazy good,” a trader dealing with Russian oil told Reuters early this year.  Most of the shipping companies transporting Russian crude—without breaching the sanctions and price cap—are based in the UAE, Greece, India, and China, and some of them are partially owned by Russian firms, according to numerous anonymous banking and trading sources who spoke to Reuters.

 ADVERTISEMENT Russian crude and petroleum product exports held high in the first half of this year, contrary to many expectations of a slump in Russian exports after the embargo. The newly-created trading firms have played a key role in keeping those exports high.   Lately, Russian crude oil exports by sea have plunged. They were estimated by Bloomberg to have averaged below 3 million bpd in the four weeks to July 30, the lowest four-week average since the start of the EU embargo.   ",Negative
New Drilling Data Reignites Surinames Oil Dream.html,"After five commercial oil discoveries in Surname’s offshore Block 58, the government in Paramaribo was optimistic the tiny, impoverished country was on track to enjoy an oil boom on the scale of neighboring Guyana. That was dealt a blow after TotalEnergies, which with a 50% interest, is the operator of Block 58, was dealt a massive blow after the supermajor chose to delay the final investment decision (FID), which was expected during 2022 or 2023. This decision occurred because drilling results did not match seismic data, while many discoveries were found to have high gas-to-oil ratios. TotalEnergies was also concerned by the worsening political and economic crisis in Suriname, where protestors stormed the former Dutch colony’s parliament earlier this year. Recent developments, however, point to Suriname’s oil boom being back on track, with the FID now expected next year. Recent drilling results from Block 58 have been promising, indicating that initial expectations, including estimations the block contains up to 6.5 billion barrels of oil, were indeed correct. In early February 2023, APA Corporation announced successful flow testing at the Sapakara South discovery. The Sapakara South-2 appraisal well, the second such well to be drilled at the discovery, found 118 feet of net oil pay in the high-quality Campano-Maastrichtian reservoir, with data indicating there are more than 200 million barrels of oil in place. That came after successful flow testing with the Sapakara South-1 well. In November 2021, APA disclosed that the appraisal well discovered 98 feet of net black oil pay in a single zone of high-quality Campano-Maastrichtian reservoir where it was identified that there are 325 million to 375 million barrels of oil in place.


 During mid-2022, the Krabdagu exploration well, where oil was discovered in February 2022, was flow tested with 110 feet of net oil pay identified in the Campanian interval, which is estimated to have over 180 million barrels of oil in place. The Krabdagu exploration well is located 11 miles west of the Sapakara South discoveries. In early May 2023, it was announced that flow testing of the Krabdagu-2 well was complete, and data analysis was underway, while the Krabdagu-3 appraisal well was underway. Block 58 Offshore Suriname Oil Discoveries  Source: APA Corporation. According to Apache, there are over 800 million barrels of oil in place across the combined Sapakara and Krabdagu wells. The Sapakara oil discovery has an API gravity of 34 degrees, with it thought to possess similar characteristics to the Liza oil grade being pumped from the Stabroek offshore Guyana, which has an API of 32 degrees and 0.52% sulfur. It is also anticipated that the petroleum discovered in Block 58 will, like the Stabroek Block, have a relatively low carbon footprint to extract, which is important n the current economy where there is considerable pressure on oil companies to make their operations carbon neutral.


 Industry analysts believed the Sapakara discovery would be developed initially, but TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné revealed in the first quarter 2023 results that the company will develop an oil hub comprised of the Sapakara and Krabdagu discoveries. Pouyanné went on to say that TotalEnergies has identified a pool of 500 million barrels of oil, and when the last well is complete with 600 million to 650 million barrels identified, then the supermajor will proceed to development. Based on these statements, the FID for Block 58, which was originally expected during 2022 or 2023, will likely be made during 2024, with the first oil slated for 2027. Interestingly, APA in its first quarter 2023 results, claimed that the partners had detected a combined volume of over 800 million barrels of oil in place from the Sapakara and Krabdagu discoveries. While APA’s resource estimate is far higher than TotalEnergies’, it does support the view that the FID for Block 58 will be next year.  These developments bode well for Suriname, which is a deeply impoverished South American country caught in a vicious economic crisis that is sparking considerable political conflict and uncertainty. For that reason, Paramaribo is desperate for Block 58 to be developed and proceed to first oil in the hope of benefiting from an economic boom on the scale of that occurring in neighboring Guyana, where gross domestic product grew 62% during 2022. Suriname’s economy is lagging behind most counties in the region where, with the exception of Venezuela, have experienced a strong post-pandemic recovery. IMF data shows Suriname’s GDP grew by a mere 1.3% last year and is forecast to expand by 2.3% in 2023. An oil boom that bolsters the economy will alleviate the economic hardship being experienced in Suriname, with the government forced to impose tough IMF-mandated austerity measures after defaulting on the country’s sovereign debt. Those reforms, which triggered spiraling double-digit inflation and caused the cost of living to rise sharply, are causing considerable suffering for everyday people, with it estimated that as much as 70% of Surname’s population lives in poverty. While oil has pried open the door for an economic recovery, time is running out for Paramaribo to exploit what is thought to be Suriname’s vast offshore hydrocarbon wealth. The looming threat of peak oil demand makes it essential for Paramaribo to access that petroleum wealth as soon as possible to head off a building economic as well as political crisis.

New Research Could Make Shale Oil Production Cheaper.html,"The U.S. shale revolution has dramatically reshaped the world energy markets. The shale boom was one of the most impressive growth stories, from take off in 2008 to the Permian stealing the mantle from Saudi Arabia’s Ghawar as the world’s highest-producing oilfield in a little over a decade.  Different methods of chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) have been developed over the years thanks to the continuous decline in conventional oil reserves as well as the accelerated increase in the global energy demand. Surfactant flooding is one of the most commonly used chemical EOR methods due to its ability to enhance recovery using multiple mechanisms including interfacial tension (IFT) reduction, wettability alteration, foam generation and emulsification. 


 However, a fresh study by Russian petroleum engineering firm Skoltech has found that using water solutions of nanoparticles and surfactants may actually trap the oil underground instead of helping it to be recovered.  Even more intriguing: the researchers have also discovered that brine is just as effective in EOR operations as more expensive surfactants.                              The researchers ran a numerical simulation and two complex lab experiments on oil shale samples to determine the effectiveness of injecting water solutions containing silicon dioxide nanoparticles or a surfactant into shale oil reservoirs to enhance recovery. The surfactant used was sodium fatty acid methyl ester sulfonate.  ""Our study considered 13 fluids and two were selected for tests on cylinder-shaped samples of oil-saturated rock from the Bazhenov Formation of Western Siberia. First we injected brine--water with a very high salt content--and measured an oil recovery factor of about 53%. This is roughly analogous to being able to extract about half of the oil in the reservoir. That figure served as the baseline value for assessing the efficiency of the two agents in the experiment, although the value under actual reservoir conditions would be lower,"" the researchers have said. While the surfactant did boost the oil recovery factor, the 53% boost was exactly the same as with brine injection, meaning shale producers might be wasting precious money. The surfactant was also found to block some of the pores in the rock thus reducing its permeability.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods recently revealed that shale producers can double crude output from their existing wells by employing novel fracking technologies. “There’s just a lot of oil being left in the ground. Fracking’s been around for a really long time, but the science of fracking is not well understood,” Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said Thursday at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions conference. Woods has revealed that Exxon is currently working on two specific areas to improve hydraulic fracturing. First off, the company is trying to frac more precisely along the well so that more oil-soaked rock gets drained. It’s also looking for ways to keep the fracked cracks open longer so as to boost the flow of oil. 


 Declining Shale Costs After years of rising production costs amid post-pandemic inflation, the U.S. shale patch can finally breathe a sigh of relief after the cost trajectory hit a turning point. Production costs fell 1% year-on-year in the second quarter, marking the first time they have shrunk in three years. Drill pipe prices have halved this year, daily rig rates are down by more than 10% and the costs of steel and diesel are also trending lower. According to Goldman Sachs via Bloomberg, Drill pipe prices have fallen by 50% this year; daily rig rates are down by more than 10% while the costs of diesel and steel have been gradually declining. Only labor has been defying this trend as wages continue rising. Whereas a decline of a single percentage point might not make much of a difference on the bottomline, Goldman says costs will be 10% lower in 2024, enough to boost profits and cash flows significantly. Easing price pressures are most welcome: after two years of bummer earnings and copious cash flows, the U.S. oil and gas sector is set to record a decline on both metrics in the current year. Big Oil Production Growth Several Big Oil companies have returned their Q2 scorecards, and nearly all have a common theme: considerable production growth but even bigger top-and bottom-line contraction.

US Crude Gains Weight Against Global Oil Benchmarks.html,"A surge in U.S. crude oil exports is changing the face of the global market and how oil is priced, with the price of U.S. crude gaining weight against other benchmarks. This is what traders and analysts have observed this year, as Europe became a major destination for U.S. oil as it sought to replace sanctioned Russian barrels. But Asia has been receiving more U.S. oil, too, because of its competitive pricing, Reuters reported, citing trade industry insiders.


 Earlier this year, in February, the number of oil swaps linked to oil produced in Texas hit a record. As of early 2023, the number of such swaps in total also sat at a record and has likely increased further since. In June, WTI Midland was added to the Brent basket of crude oil grades that is used as a benchmark for pricing the world's most traded oil contract. Plans to add it to the Brent basket had been underway for some time but were only finalized this year as the surge in U.S. production coincided with a stable decline in the output from the five fields that comprised the original Brent. These developments were made possible by the shale revolution that turned the United States into the world's biggest oil producer and a major exporter, especially since last year when the European Union embargoed Russian crude oil and fuels. And because U.S. crude is so competitive, it is probably going to gain further ground on international markets. ""As Midland becomes more and more important in the dated Brent assessment, it has a knock-on effect on other grades having to price themselves lower to compete with WTI Midland,"" Reuters quoted Vortexa market analyst Rohit Rathod as saying.  Related: India Scoops Up Cheapest Russian Oil Since Start Of Ukraine War The reason Midland is becoming more and more important in the dated Brent assessment is, again, the volume of U.S. crude being shipped abroad, which has averaged over 4 million barrels daily since the start of the year. The pricing power that U.S. crude has acquired over Brent and, through the abovementioned knock-on effect on other benchmarks as well makes these benchmarks more vulnerable to production swings in the U.S. Analysts noted this was to be expected when WTI Midland was added to the Brent basket as was a greater influence of U.S. politics on global oil prices. Yet politics aside, the growing clout of U.S. oil means that any downward change in U.S. production would have an upward effect on global prices and vice versa. For instance, the recent streak of drilling rig declines as reported by Baker Hughes, suggests flattening oil production.


 Separately, Reuters' John Kemp recently reported that production growth in May compared to April was a meager 19,000 bpd, excluding the Gulf of Mexico—a further suggestion that U.S. oil production growth may be slowing down because of the price slump from earlier this year. At the same time, however, Bloomberg reported last week that some shale majors have been revising upwards their production targets for the year. Per the report, the reason for the revisions was not the recent oil price improvement. It was a boost in well productivity that few appear to have expected. The news is a reversal of last year's sentiment among some industry executives who worried that shale wells are underperforming in terms of productivity, raising questions about the longevity of the shale boom. Now, it turns out that what seemed like the inevitable is not, in fact, inevitable. Trends and developments like the above would have normally affected U.S. prices more than any other benchmarks. Since this June, this is no longer the case, and whatever happens in the U.S. shale patch also affects the price of oil in Europe and the Middle East as well to a much more substantial degree than before. All this appears to be good news for oil buyers. According to the traders who spoke to Reuters for the abovementioned report, the abundance of U.S. oil internationally and its competitive pricing is essentially putting a sort of a cap on other producers' prices as well.

 ADVERTISEMENT As Saudi Arabia raises its oil prices yet again amid curbed production, WTI could become even more attractive to refiners in Asia and Europe. However, this increase in attractiveness would only be to a certain degree: the Saudis are curbing the supply of medium sour crude, which WTI is not. And sour crude prices have recently surged regardless of increased U.S. exports globally because demand has been outstripping supply. That said, the curbs on Saudi oil output would benefit U.S. producers, just like previous cuts benefited them by boosting international prices, of which WTI is now a much bigger part than before. It seems that even with such a change in the pricing balance amid the influx of U.S. oil, the global market remains as interconnected as it has ever been, with its various parts as interdependent as before.",Negative

Russia, looking to quietly sell its oil at a discount to the OPEC+ rate through backdoor channels, as also analysed by OilPrice.com, said it will taper its 500,000 bpd additional export cut for August to 300,000 bpd in September. These extended cuts come on top of the 3.66 million bpd in collective cuts from the OPEC+ oil cartel implemented since October 2022. The key questions now are: will OPEC+ keep oil prices rising through further production cuts and, if so, what can the West do about it? The short answer to the first question is ‘yes’, with Saudi Energy Ministry sources quoted last week in the official Saudi press agency as saying that the Kingdom’s oil output could go even lower if needed. The sources added: “This additional voluntary cut comes to reinforce the precautionary efforts made by OPEC+ countries with the aim of supporting the stability and balance of oil markets.” For Saudi Arabia, the only possible reason to stop cutting production to keep prices rising evaporated when it formalised its move away from the U.S. sphere of influence and into that of China and Russia with the resumption of relationship deal agreed with Iran in March, brokered by Beijing, and analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. For two key reasons examined shortly, the U.S. and its core allies see rising oil and gas prices (historically the price of gas is 70 percent derived from the price of oil) as serious economic and political threats to them, given that they are generally major net importers of energy. For China, another net importer of energy, these threats are diminished as they can buy oil and gas at substantial discounts to the OPEC+ price from Russia and several other OPEC+ members.   Related: Saudi Aramco’s Q2 Earnings Drop 38% On Lower Oil Prices Given the removal of the U.S. constraint on moving oil and gas prices ever higher, Saudi Arabia and its OPEC brothers want to push them as high as they can without choking off significant demand from their customers. Ever since the end of the calamitous 2014-2016 Oil Price War started by Saudi Arabia, as also analysed in my new book on the new global oil market order, these countries have needed to keep repairing the damage done to their finances during that period, and the subsequent 2020 Oil Price War. In theory, Saudi Arabia has a fiscal breakeven oil price of US$78 pb of Brent in 2023, which given its mean average US$1-2 pb lifting cost of a barrel oil (the lowest in the world, along with Iran and Iraq) would seem to offer s substantial financial cushion for it. In practice, though, given its spiralling financial commitments to various socio-economic and vanity projects, its fiscal breakeven oil price is a lot higher than that, and constantly rising. The same applies to a greater or lesser to degree to all its OPEC brothers. For Russia in the broader OPEC+ grouping, the same reason to keep oil and gas prices rising are also in place, but with a twist. Although it has a fiscal breakeven oil price of around US$115 pb of Brent this year, the key consideration for it is how best to work around the various bans and price caps that were introduced on its oil and gas exports following its invasion of Ukraine last year – including the introduction of a general oil price cap on Russian oil at US$60 per barrel. Given this, Russia’s strategy has been very straightforward, but very effective: persuade Saudi Arabia to increase the OPEC group’s oil prices as much as possible while at the same time selling its own oil at a discount to this price, but still above the official oil price cap. And there are plenty of willing buyers for discounted Russian oil whether it is at or above the US$60 pb barrel price cap, including China and India.  For the U.S. and its core allies, ever-increasing oil and gas prices have caused dramatic spikes in inflation and the interest rates required to combat it, which in turn make economic recessions more likely. For the U.S. itself, these fears have very specific ramifications: one economic and one political, as also analysed in my new book on the new global oil market order. The economic one is that historically every US$10 pb change in the price of crude oil results in a 25-30 cent change in the price of a gallon of gasoline. For every 1 cent that the average price per gallon of gasoline rises, more than US$1 billion per year in consumer spending is lost, and the U.S. economy suffers. The political one is that, according to statistics from the U.S.’s National Bureau of Economic Research, since the end of World War I in 2018, the sitting U.S. president has won re-election 11 times out of 11 if the U.S. economy was not in recession within two years of an upcoming election. However, sitting U.S. presidents who went into a re-election campaign with the economy in recession won only one time out of seven. This is not a position sitting President Joe Biden, or the Democratic Party, wants to be in one year out from the next U.S. election. So, what can the West do about it? Any idea the U.S. had at persuading Saudi Arabia and its OPEC brothers to stop their production cuts was torpedoed when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his UAE counterpart Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan refused to take a telephone call from President Joe Biden in early March 2022 – at the height of the crisis after the Russian invasion of Ukraine - to discuss them doing that very thing. Meanwhile, the opportunities in the very short-term to dramatically increase production in the U.S.’s shale fields, or the conventional ones, to counterbalance for lost OPEC+ production are extremely limited. Similarly, there is little realistic prospect of major strategic petroleum reserve releases from both the U.S. and International Energy Agency countries being sustained for as long as OPEC+ can keep cutting supplies.   This is one reason why, as exclusively revealed in OilPrice.com, the U.S. has been in discussion with Iran since the end of June to put a new version of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or colloquially ‘the nuclear deal’) in place within the next three months. An adjunct reason for this is that it would be the beginning of significant U.S. attempts to drive a wedge into the newly formed Saudi Arabia-Iran relationship under China’s influence. The aim is for the new deal to be in place before the onset of the winter months. The new version will be short-term, a senior source who works closely with Iran’s Petroleum Ministry exclusively told OilPrice.com at the end of June. And it will not include the specific conditions relating to the Financial Action Task Force and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that stymied previous talks on such a deal, as also analysed in my new book on the new global oil market order. The only key stipulations being made by the U.S. in these ongoing negotiations is that Iran pledges to keep its uranium enrichment at or below 60 percent and that it agrees to regular inspections again from independent nuclear watchdogs.  Over and above the geopolitical positives for the U.S. and its allies in this new JCPOA, would be the inflow of big flows of oil and gas from Iran to counteract the reductions from OPEC+. According to a senior analyst at global energy markets intelligence company Kpler, spoken to exclusively by OilPrice.com at the time, Iran could see an 80 percent recovery of full production within six months and a 100 percent recovery within 12 months. “Ultimately, we believe Iranian production could technically jump by 1.7 million bpd including 200,000 bpd of condensate and LPG/ethane, in a 6-to-9-month period from when sanctions are lifted and an immediate impact of a 5-10 percent fall in the oil price would be likely,” the analyst concluded.",Positive
Saudi Arabias Budget Deficit Jumps By 80 Due To Lower Oil Revenues.html,"Higher expenditures on diversification from oil amid lower oil export revenues resulted in a widening budget deficit in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude oil exporter.  Saudi government deficit jumped by 80% from the first quarter to $1.4 billion (5.3 billion Saudi riyals) in the second quarter of 2023, as spending on social benefits and capital expenditures jumped, according to data from the Saudi Finance Ministry cited by Bloomberg. 


 Non-oil revenues rose substantially, but oil revenues only inched up 0.6% compared to the first quarter and plunged by 28% compared to the second quarter of 2022, the data showed.   Saudi Arabia continues to expect a budget surplus for full-year 2023, but many analysts do not.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in May that Saudi Arabia needed oil prices at $80.90 per barrel to balance its budget this year.  Saudi Arabia’s economy is set to markedly slow down this year from last year’s 8.7% growth due to the oil production cuts the world’s top crude exporter is implementing in a bid to “stabilize the market.” The Kingdom saw its economic growth forecast for 2023 slashed by the most among major economies in the World Economic Outlook Update by the IMF this week. 


 Lower exports and lower oil prices are already shrinking Saudi Arabia’s oil export revenues—the mainstay of its budget revenues accounting for around 80% of total export revenues. Saudi Arabia’s oil revenues plunged in May to the lowest level since September 2021, official data showed last month as the Kingdom lowered shipments while oil prices were significantly lower than in the spring of last year. Oil revenues slumped by 37.7% year over year to $19.2 billion (72 billion Saudi riyals) in May 2023.  Saudi Arabia’s continued efforts to prop up oil prices with large production cuts will slow down its economy, which could even shrink this year and become one of the worst performers among G20, from the fastest-growing economy in this group last year, analysts say. ",Positive
The Fall Of Ecuadors Oil Empire.html,"A 2005 to 2015 oil boom under the stewardship of leftist President Rafael Correa pulled Ecuador, one of South America’s poorest countries, out of poverty. After securing greater government control of the hydrocarbon sector, which led to substantially higher oil rents boosting Quito’s coffers, Correa spent lavishly on social programs such as health and education. This saw millions of people lifted from poverty in the tiny Andean country of less than twenty million, which at the end of the twentieth century had been gutted by a devastating financial crisis. The transformation was remarkable, by 2015, nearly 40% of Ecuador’s population was classified as middle class. Then disaster struck, oil prices collapsed, which, along with heavy-handed state intervention and mounting anti-oil protests, caused foreign energy investment to dry up, leading to declining production and, ultimately sharply lower petroleum revenues.  Since the start of this decade, Ecuador’s oil industry has appeared as a mere shadow of its former self. Economically crucial petroleum production is caught in an irreversible downward trend. After peaking at a multidecade high of 557,000 barrels per day in 2014, during the last oil boom, petroleum production has trended lower, plunging to a multidecade low of 473,000 barrels per day for 2021, which was the lowest volume since 2003. There are signs of further pain ahead, with data from the Ministry of Energy and Mines showing that Ecuador only lifted an average of 452,603 barrels per day during July 2023, an 8% drop compared to the same period a year earlier. 


 A combination of political crises, endemic corruption, anti-oil industry protests, corroded infrastructure and falling foreign energy investment are all weighing on attempts to bolster petroleum output to pre-pandemic levels. This forced the government of rightwing President Guillermo Lasso to slash the annual daily 2023 production target of 540,000 barrels per day by 8%, or 40,000 barrels, which reduced it to 480,000 barrels daily. Based on current production data from the Energy Ministry and recent events, with civil unrest and yet another political crisis rocking Ecuador, even this revised target appears unachievable. The February 2023 shuttering of the Petroecuador-owned SOTE pipeline and privately controlled OCP pipeline, which both connect key oilfields in the Amazon to the Pacific port of Esmeraldas, forced Quito to declare force majeure and suspend oil exports. The impact this had on Ecuador’s oil production and exports was further complicated by national oil company Petroecuador declaring force majeure for four oil blocks in Orellana province because of protests by Indigenous communities. That, according to energy ministry data, caused March 2023 oil output to plunge nearly 10% month over month to 448,387 barrels per day. Production outages due to pipeline failures and protests in the Amazon region remain a constant hazard. It was ruptures of the SOTE and OCP pipelines that were responsible for one of Ecuador’s worst oil spills in recent years during 2020. The pipelines were ruptured by landslides and subsidence after a period of heavy rains causing nearly 16,000 barrels of oil to spill into the Coca River and nearby countryside. The oil not only threatened local water supplies but flowed into the Napo River, a tributary of the Amazon, causing considerable damage in one of the world’s most environmentally sensitive areas. The SOTE pipeline ruptured again in May 2023, near Nueva Loja, the capital of Sucumbíos province, spilling oil into the San Miguel and Conejo rivers. It is claimed that there have been over 1,000 oil spills in Ecuador’s ecologically sensitive Amazon, causing irreparable damage, which is often aggravated by poor and incomplete clean-up efforts by Petroecuador. The key culprit for the ruptured pipelines is heavy erosion of the Coca River, which began with the completion of the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Dam in 2016. Regressive erosion caused the 2020 collapse of Ecuador’s largest waterfall, the San Rafael Waterfall, on the Coca River, and for the waterbody to change course, it also continues to threaten the nearby oil pipelines. Any government initiatives aimed at rebuilding and updating existing energy infrastructure, such as the SOTE and OCP pipelines as well as the ramshackle 110,000 barrel per day Esmeraldas refinery, Ecuador’s largest such facility, are on hold. President Lasso’s government has been mired in scandals since taking office on 24 May 2021. After a recent attempt by Congress to impeach Lasso, Ecuador’s president utilized a clause in the country’s constitution to dissolve the legislature and initiate early general elections for the presidency as well as the legislature. Tha comes after mid-2022 protests against Lasso’s administration due to a spiraling cost of living rocked Ecuador forcing Quito to declare force majeure, thereby halting all oil exploration and production activities.


 Heightened political instability, which is an ever-present problem, is being aggravated by an explosion in violence focused on Ecuador’s largest city, the Pacific port of Guayaquil and the northern port city of Esmeraldas. Soaring violence is being fueled by cocaine trafficking, with Ecuador now an important cocaine transshipment location with the country wedged between the world’s largest cocaine manufacturers Colombia and Peru. This has seen Mexican cartels and Colombian as well as European organized crime groups establish a sizeable presence in the tiny South American country, building alliances with local prison and street gangs. As a result, between 2018 and 2022, Ecuador’s murder rate more than quadrupled to 26 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. This is also weighing heavily on foreign investment, notably for the economically crucial hydrocarbon sector. The multitude of crises engulfing Ecuador, which are directly and indirectly impacting the Andean country’s economically vital petroleum industry, makes it difficult to see how Quito can reverse the trend and grow production. This will impact an economy where oil is responsible for 6% to 10% of gross domestic product, more than 20% of government revenue and is the largest export representing 36% of all goods shipped abroad by value. Recent events could not have occurred at the worst time, with Quito struggling to rein in elevated levels of debt and boost declining fiscal income. For these reasons, Ecuador could end up on the precipice of another economic crisis which will ratchet-up the considerable hardships already being faced by a population still struggling with the fallout from the pandemic.",Positive
OPEC Leaves Oil Output Levels Unchanged.html,"  The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) of OPEC+ affirmed on Friday the current levels of oil production of the group and didn’t make any recommendation to change the output at this time. 


 In a very short meeting, as expected, the JMMC panel, which regularly discusses the situation on the market and the need for OPEC+ intervention, rubberstamped the OPEC+ decisions from June 4, when the current cuts – initially set for May through December 2023 – were extended to the end of 2024.     The Friday meeting, scheduled for months, was preceded by a Saudi announcement on Thursday that the Kingdom would extend its unilateral voluntary cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) into September.  Russia, the leader of the non-OPEC producers in the OPEC+ group, also announced an extension in its export cuts into September, although the pledged cut will be lower than in August.   Russia will cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. Russia has said it would reduce its August oil exports by 500,000 bpd.  Today’s meeting of the OPEC+ panel, agreed there was no need for further market intervention at present, as widely expected. But the panel noted that it could intervene if necessary. 


 “The committee will continue to closely assess market conditions noting the willingness of the DoC countries to address market developments and stand ready to take additional measures at any time, building on the strong cohesion of OPEC and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries,” OPEC said in a statement after the short panel meeting.  The panel also “reiterated its appreciation” to Saudi Arabia for the extension of its unilateral cut into September, “aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market,” and acknowledged Russia’s commitment to cut oil exports in September by 300,000 bpd.  The next meeting of the JMMC is scheduled to take place on October 4, 2023.

One Sector To Watch Oil As Oil Prices Rally.html,"After remaining range-bound for much of the second quarter, oil prices have mounted a significant rally, with analysts saying oil markets are finally waking up to the fact that fundamentals have tightened significantly. After remaining in surplus for months, many experts have predicted that demand will begin to surpass supply thus improving oil prices and margins for oil refiners. For instance, StanChart’s demand model projects a supply deficit of 2.81 million barrels per day in August; 2.43 mb/d in September and more than 2mb/d in November and December. The analysts have also projected that global inventories will fall by 310 mb by end-2023 and another 94 mb in the first quarter of 2024 thus pushing oil prices higher.   Although U.S. oil refinery margins have halved since the middle of 2022, they remain at historically high levels and are likely to remain elevated through the summer of 2023 thanks to high operating rates and low fuel stocks. Gross margins for refining three barrels of crude to produce two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of distillate fuel oil have retreated to $33 per barrel from a record $60 at the start of June 2022. Still, margins are in the 95th percentile for all trading days since 2001, underpinning refinery profitability and encouraging high levels of capacity utilization.  Revenues and profits for refining companies have declined from last year’s historical highs but remain at healthy levels. Here are three refining stocks to keep an eye on. Marathon Petroleum Corp Market Cap: $54.3B Dividend Yield: 2.6% YTD Returns: 22.5% Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is an integrated downstream energy company and the largest petroleum refinery operator in the United States. The company’s latest earnings revealed strong refinery demand despite general economic malaise. Marathon’s Q2 2023 revenue of $36.82B (-32.1% Y/Y) beats the Wall Street consensus by $2.94B while GAAP EPS of $5.32 beat by $0.74. Net income fell to $2.23B, or $5.32/share, from $5.87B, or $10.95/share from a year ago while adjusted EBITDA was cut in half to $4.53B from $9.06B a year ago. Refining & Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA fell to $11.88/bbl from $27.79/bbl for the prior-year quarter while segment margin was $22.10/bbl compared with $37.54/bbl in last year’s corresponding quarter.Crude capacity utilization clocked in at 93% with total throughput of 2.9M bbl/day.  Related: Big Oil’s Cash Restraint Begins To Cause Worry Marathon Ol continues returning copious amounts of cash to shareholders: The company revealed that it returned ~$3.4B of capital through $3.1B of stock buybacks and $316M of dividends in the second quarter. The company’s diversification into renewables gives Marathon Oil better protection from fluctuating oil prices and refining margins. PBF Energy Inc. Market Cap: $6.0B Dividend Yield: 1.3% YTD Returns: 26.2% PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) engages in refining and supplying petroleum products. PBF is one of the youngest oil refiners in the United States having been created in 2008. The company released its quarterly earnings report on Thursday, with revenue of $9.16B (-34.9% Y/Y) beating by $230M while Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.29 beat by $0.05. In-line with the industry trend, Q2 net income fell to $1.02B, or $7.88/share, from $1.2B, or $9.65/share, in the year-earlier quarter.  production fell slightly to 945,700 bbl/day from 958,800 bbl/day a year earlier. Refinery throughput fell to 935,800 bbl/day from 958,800 bbl/day a year ago and expects full-year production to average 915K-975K bbl/day. And, just like its bigger peer, PBF Energy is diversifying into renewables: the company announced it had begun operations at its St. Bernard renewable fuel joint venture in New Orleans, and managed to sell the first products from the facility in July. The 50-50 joint venture with Eni S.p.A.(NYSE:E) has a processing capacity of ~1.1M tons/year of raw materials and will produce ~7.3M bbl/year of renewable diesel. Phillips 66 Market Cap: $48.5B Dividend Yield: 3.9% YTD Returns:9.0% Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is one of the oldest refineries in the United States. The company operates as an energy manufacturing and logistics company, with its refining segment one of its largest. Phillips 66 reported Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $3.87, beating the consensus by $0.31. The company does not report revenue figures but said it generated $1.0 billion of operating cash flow ($2.0 billion excluding working capital).  Realized refining margins fell to $15.32/bbl from $28.62/bbl a year ago. Phillips 66 revealed that it plans to run its refineries in the mid-90% range of their combined crude oil throughput capacity of 1.9M bbl/day in Q3, close to second quarter’s figure at 93%. Phillips 66 announced that its Rodeo refinery in California will be fully converted to renewable diesel production by the first quarter of 2024 when it is scheduled to begin commercial operation.",Positive
Big Oils Cash Restraint Begins To Cause Worry.html,"These past two weeks saw yet another strong quarterly showing for Big Oil despite substantial declines in earnings, following the trajectory of oil pieces since last year. Once again, the supermajors and the large independents were betting on shareholder returns over production growth, sticking to their new, post-pandemic, mid-transition approach. 


 Until now, this approach has been largely praised by the media and analysts. Now, it seems the restraint has started to brew some concern. And maybe it’s time it did. Bloomberg’s Kevin Crowley reported this week that Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies together produced 11.6 million barrels of oil equivalent daily during the second quarter. That, he said, was the lowest production rate for the big five in at least 15 years and a fifth lower than their 2010 production rate. It was time to change this. The conclusion in the above report might seem confusing given Bloomberg’s copious reporting on climate change and the success of the energy transition. Yet facts are that oil and gas are still consumed on a massive scale globally. And if less oil and gas is being produced, that’s bad news for pretty much everyone.  Related: Oil Prices Jump As Saudi Arabia Extends Oil Production Cut In fairness, BP and Shell have both made a sort of a U-turn on their net-zero commitments this year. Both companies had previously set extremely ambitious targets— including sizeable cuts in oil and gas production—but now, both have signaled a pullback from net zero and a greater focus on oil and gas. “It is critical that we avoid dismantling the current energy system faster than we are able to build the clean energy system of the future,” Shell’s new chief executive Wael Sawan said, as quoted by the Financial Times, earlier this year. The statement accompanies a pledge to continue investing in oil and gas, maintain oil production, and boost gas output. BP’s Bernard Looney made a similar statement in February when the company reported record profits for 2022, boosted by the oil and gas price shocks. At the presentation of these results Looney said that BP had revised down its oil and gas production cut targets for 2030 from 40% to 25%.


 Given Looney’s previous exclusive focus on growing in areas like wind, solar, and EV charging and scaling back BP’s core business to embrace the energy transition, the revised target marks a significant departure from previous priorities. Yet neither of these two supermajors is planning on boosting their oil production. That should worry investors and regular energy consumers. Because Chevron’s and Exxon’s production growth plans are modest, and they focus almost entirely on the Permian. They can’t, in other words, offset BP’s production cutbacks and Shell’s stagnation. If these two remain on the agenda, that is. Last year’s price rally in hydrocarbons showed that it takes a record profit or two to convince supermajors that perhaps they don’t need to go all in the transition. This year’s still strong prices may strengthen that conviction. And, of course, there’s TotalEnergies signing a multibillion-dollar deal with Iraq for the development of new oil fields. Big Oil is not giving up on oil and gas. Yet it is being a lot more cautious about production growth and likely to remain cautious amid all the activist investor, government, and activist pressure. This means supply from the supermajors may well tighten in the next few years, especially after their exit from Russia and an overall shortage of new discovery opportunities.

 ADVERTISEMENT Bloomberg’s Crowley noted that the decline in production was, indeed, partially a result of this exit and asset sales. The problem is that, as he put it, “companies cannot discover another Guyana every year.” The bigger problem, however, is that they seem reluctant even to try to discover another Guyana. Because of all that talk about peak oil demand and the triumph of the transition.",Positive
An Oil Boom Is Underway In Ghana.html,"Several African countries have welcomed investment in oil and gas in recent years, as parts of the continent undergo industrialization and investors look to develop new reserves. Africa provides companies with the potential for low-cost, low-carbon oil and gas in largely unexplored areas. But governments across the region hope to be more closely involved in operations, ensuring that they get a significant proportion of the revenues to bolster their economies. One such country is Ghana, which expects an oil boom over the next decade and beyond.  At the COP27 climate summit last year, several African state leaders presented the case for the development of the region’s oil and gas resources. Following a year of shortages and surging energy prices, several countries with oil and gas potential urged investors to develop new, low-carbon operations to meet the global demand without having to rely on aging, carbon-heavy operations. And many energy firms are now viewing regions such as Africa and the Caribbean as vital to their aims to decarbonize. 


 In Ghana, there are 17 oil and gas projects in the 2023 to 2027 pipeline. This includes 3 upstream projects, nine projects in the midstream sector, and five new downstream projects. Ghana is now one of Africa’s fastest-growing hydrocarbon producers. There are several oil operations already underway in the West African country, with Phase 1 of the Pecan Conventional Oilfield as well as the Jubilee South East field and Ntomme Far West Development.  Pecan is expected to have a capacity of 82,500 bpd when production begins in 2025, with phase 1 costing $1.5 billion. It is operated by exploration and production company Aker Energy Ghana Ltd. (50%); petroleum corporation Lukoil (38%); Ghana’s state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) (10%); and transport company Bulk Ship & Trade (2%). Meanwhile, the Jubilee South East field should begin producing 37,000 bpd by the end of the year. The field is operated by Tullow Oil (38.98%), deepwater exploration and production company Kosmos Energy (38.61%); the GNPC (19.69%); and South Africa’s National Oil Company (NOC) PetroSA (2.72%). Ghana hopes to discover further oil and gas deposits in the Ntomme Far West Development, with a pre-feasibility analysis having taken place and exploration drilling planned for later this year.  Meanwhile, the country’s midstream sector will expand alongside exploration and production operations. Ghana plans to develop the Tema Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) Plant, the Tema VI Liquids Storage Terminal, the Dixcove Oil Storage Facility, the Wa Oil Storage Facility and the Tema-Akosombo II and Tema Pipelines between 2023 to 2027.  In March this year, the African Energy Chamber stated that Ghana hopes to double its oil output by the end of the year, from 180,000 bpd to 420,000 bpd. The CEO of the Petroleum Commission of Ghana, Egbert Faibille Jr., stated “Ghana has positioned itself to attract investments in the energy sector. We present one of the best investment opportunities in the sub-region. Following the Jubilee discovery in 2007, 30 additional discoveries have been made and are pending appraisal and development. Ghana guarantees attractive fiscal terms. These terms have proven over the years to provide a favorable investment framework.” Faibille added, “We have several blocks open for direct negotiation and three available for farm-in opportunities. We have some fields that are in pre-development, so if we are able to get contractors, we should see a surge in production by 2030.” Ghana’s oil operations are already well underway, with the country expecting to open a new $1.98 billion oil refinery in Tema this month. The Sentuo Group’s facility is expected to produce 5 million metric tonnes of petroleum products including liquified petroleum gas (LPG), jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil. Ghana's Minister of Trade and Industry confirmed last month that Sentuo is in discussions with the government to acquire 500,000 barrels of crude for refining. By 2025, Sentuo plans to expand the facility to refine 4.26 million tonnes of petroleum products. 


 Meanwhile, Britain’s Tullow Oil announced the start of operations at the Jubilee South East (JSE) project in July. The company said that the first well started producing, with another two producers and a water injector expected to come online later in the year. Tullow hopes the field will produce over 100,000 bpd once operational. The firm’s CEO stated, “Successful start-up at Jubilee South East is a significant milestone for Tullow and for Ghana.” He added, “We are well positioned for future growth with production ramping up in the second half of 2023 that will generate significant free cash flow. This marks the start of material deleveraging as we continue our transition into a low-debt business with the financial flexibility to pursue value accretive opportunities.”  Ghana is viewed as Africa’s rising star, thanks to its stable political system, growing economy, and the rapid development of its oil and gas sector. There are several projects in the pipeline, with oil production expected to increase significantly by 2030. Ghana could provide oil producers with the opportunity to develop the low-cost, low-carbon oil needed to meet the high global demand en route to an eventual global energy transition.",Negative
Hedge Funds Boost Bullish Bets On Oil.html,"Money managers have grown increasingly optimistic about a recovery in oil prices and have raced to close out bearish bets on petroleum futures over the past month.   Shrinking supply due to the OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia’s cuts and resilient demand despite recession fears – with oil consumption estimated to have already set record highs in July – have made fundamentals look increasingly bullish for the rest of the year. Macroeconomic sentiment in the oil market has also improved, with Fed cues that the U.S. could manage to avoid a recession and expected stimulus in China, the world’s top crude oil importer, to prop up an unconvincing economic rebound after the end of the Covid restrictions.   


 “The market has abandoned its growth pessimism,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the note this weekend.  Judging from the hedge fund positioning in the latest reporting week to July 25 and the four weeks prior, market participants started to expect oil prices to move higher as Saudi Arabia began its unilateral cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for July and August.   The Saudis have succeeded in changing the perception of market balances for this year and next, and – as Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has frequently said – “punish the short sellers.”  Related: Oil Prices Jump As Saudi Arabia Extends Oil Production Cut In the most recent week with data from exchanges, portfolio managers bought the equivalent of 52 million barrels in the six most important petroleum contracts, according to estimates by Reuters market analyst John Kemp.  Over the past month, hedge funds have slashed short positions and added fresh longs, expecting a tighter market this summer and an improved macroeconomic picture in the United States.  In the WTI contracts, the bullish bets increased by the equivalent of 65 million barrels between June 27 and July 25, while the bearish bets were slashed by 104 million barrels, Kemp’s estimates on data from exchanges show.   The net long positions—the difference between bullish and bearish bets—in WTI Crude and Brent Crude jumped to a three-month high in the week ending July 25.  Oil prices have also hit the highest in three months, shaking off some of the economic doom and gloom and expectations of a hit to oil demand. 


 Demand is not only resilient but headed for a record high in the coming months, according to analysts including Goldman Sachs and oil executives, including ExxonMobil’s CEO Darren Woods. The world will see a record-high demand for oil this year, Exxon’s top executive told CNBC on Friday. Global oil demand reached a record high of 102.8 million bpd in July, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note on Sunday. The Wall Street bank expects the robust demand to lead to a wider-than-expected deficit of as much as 1.8 million bpd in the second half of 2023 and to 600,000 bpd deficit in 2024.  Demand looks stronger than many had expected early in the second quarter.  Oil demand outside China is holding up “far better” than most have feared, while the very aggressive OPEC+ cuts are leading to a deficit on the market, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs’s global head of commodities research, told CNBC on Monday.  As a result of the expected deficits, Brent Crude prices could rise to $93 a barrel in the second quarter of 2024, according to Goldman Sachs.

 ADVERTISEMENT Early on Wednesday, Brent was trading above $85 per barrel, and the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, topped $82 a barrel for the first time since the middle of April.  The macroeconomic sentiment has also improved, with the recent inflation data from the U.S. showing slowing price increases and China expected to support its economy out of the slower-than-expected growth in the second quarter.  In the current macro and fundamentals environment, “Oil remains one of the most attractive trades and buyers will likely emerge on every dip,” Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said on Tuesday.  ",Positive
85 Is Just The Beginning Of The Oil Rally.html,"Earlier this week, media reported that oil production from the members of OPEC had fallen to the lowest since 2021—or 2020, depending on the source—thanks to voluntary production cuts from Saudi Arabia and involuntary declines in Nigeria, Angola, and Libya. The news naturally pushed oil prices higher. Yet they have already begun to climb as traders have finally started paying attention to the supply warnings and demand projections that banks and other analysts have been issuing for weeks.


 The jump in prices should have made Riyadh happy, and it probably did. The question now is how much higher the Saudis would let prices go before starting to relax their cuts. The Saudi Arabian economy grew by a modest 1.1% in the second quarter of the year, which was down from 3.8% in the first quarter. Media and analysts attributed the slowdown to lower oil prices, even though the Kingdom’s non-oil sector booked a pretty healthy 5.5% growth rate. Yet the weight that the oil trade has in the overall economy remains overwhelming despite Riyadh’s efforts to diversify. And this means that it needs even higher oil prices—to continue with the diversification efforts. Bloomberg’s Grant Smith suggested this week that the Saudis may decide to relax the cut from September as Brent moves to $85 and above. The reasoning was that refiners would welcome the additional barrels, and the Saudis would be happy to boost their market share after losing some of it because of the voluntary cuts.  Related: Oil Falls Despite Massive Crude Inventory Draw On the other hand, Smith wrote, longtime OPEC observers were not convinced this would be enough for the Saudis to relax the cuts. Uncertainty about demand was one reason cited, and the risk of disrupting the discipline of OPEC as a whole was another. Ultimately, however, the Saudis can keep the cap on output for exactly as long as they need to in order to get prices where they want them to be. It is yet another demonstration that not only is OPEC very much alive and relevant in today’s world, but its de facto leader still has plenty of sway over the group. “The kingdom will want to see a protracted rise toward $90 a barrel and possibly improvement in Chinese economic data to start considering putting the 1 million barrels per day back into the market,” PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga told Bloomberg earlier this week. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs updated its outlook on oil demand in a way that should please Riyadh. The bank said oil demand had hit a record in July, reaching 102.8 million barrels daily, and that this would lead to a deficit of 1.8 million bpd in the second quarter of the year.


 In such a context, there is really no rush for Saudi Arabia to return those barrels to the market. Especially if they are not exactly a whole million. This was suggested by an unnamed EU source who spoke to Oilprice.com’s Simon Watkins, saying that the production data for Saudi Arabia showed no cuts were being made from fields that the Saudis operate in a neutral zone that the Kingdom shares with Kuwait. In other words, Saudi Arabia may be cutting some barrels but pumping plenty in the neutral zone and selling those “under the radar,” as Watkins reported. This would allow it to benefit from higher prices, boost its market share, and simultaneously continue to exert upward pressure on prices with the official cuts. Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute did the Saudis a huge favor by reporting an estimated 15.4-million-barrel inventory drop for last week. The massive figure seriously exceeded analyst expectations, which were for a much more moderate inventory decline of less than a million barrels. Traders are rushing to cover their short positions in oil, too, and this is boosting prices further. The benchmarks jumped to a three-month high this week as funds bought crude and fuels and changed their bets from bearish to bullish. All this works in Saudi Arabia’s favor, and it also suggests prices could reach the level Riyadh would like to see sooner rather than later. And that’s when things would get interesting: announcing an end to the cuts would be unwise as it would immediately cause a plunge in prices. A gradual relaxation is a more likely option, as suggested by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg this week.

 ADVERTISEMENT According to them, the Saudis could decide to relax the cuts by 250,000 to 500,000 barrels daily from next month. Then again, they might decide to stick with them for another month and see how high prices would go. Some, like Energy Aspects’ Amrita Sen, have forecast that Brent could hit $100 before the year’s end thanks not just to cuts but the shrinking inventories as well. That was a month ago. Now, Reuters is also reporting that global oil inventories are in decline. It would take a negative GDP growth reading for the U.S. or China to stop this rally.",Positive
Oil Falls Despite Massive Crude Inventory Draw.html,"WTI crude futures didn't move higher today after the Energy Information Administration confirmed the substantial inventory draw estimated by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. After the startling revision in U.S. oil demand in May, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 17 million barrels for the final week of July, which compared with a modest decline of 700,000 barrels for the previous week.


 The API on Tuesday reported that oil inventories in the U.S. had declined by 15.4 million barrels, which was the largest draw in years and immediately pushed oil prices even higher. According to the EIA, on the other hand, at 439.8 million barrels crude oil inventories are 1% below the five-year average for this time of the year. In gasoline, the authority estimated an inventory build of 1.5 million barrels for the last week of July, with production averaging 9.8 million barrels daily. These figures compared with a stock decline of 800,000 barrels for the previous week and a production rate of 9.5 million barrels daily. In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 800,000 barrels for the week to July 28, with production averaging 4.9 million bpd. This compared with an inventory draw of 200,000 barrels for the previous week and a production rate of 4.8 million barrels daily.


 Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate topped $82 per barrel earlier this week and Brent crude jumped above $85 per barrel as demand forecasts suggested a sizeable supply deficit for the second half of the year. Production remains constrained by OPEC+ cuts and outages. As a result, the U.S. Department of Energy just pulled back an offer to buy 6 million barrels of crude for the strategic petroleum reserve. The offer was made in early July, when WTI was trading below $72. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $84.12 per barrel with WTI changing hands at $80.65 per barrel, both down from opening.

Dwindling Rig Count May Finally Lead To Lower Shale Oil Output.html,"Despite record U.S. oil production last year, output this year is set to decline, with the oil rig count dropping over the last three months. The U.S. saw increased activity in its oil and gas fields last year following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and low OPEC oil output, which led President Biden to plead with domestic producers to boost their output, to tackle shortages and rising prices. However, many private companies could not maintain this level of output, and others are now biding their time until oil prices rise again, driving down U.S. production in shale regions.  Biden urged oil and gas producers in the U.S. to boost production levels last year following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent energy shortages, which drove the price of energy sky-high. This was essentially to counter the OPEC decision to limit global oil production, with quotas still in place from the pandemic, pushing prices up even further. Thanks to efforts to increase U.S. oil output over the last year, production levels are expected to hit 12.61 million bpd, compared to the previous record of 12.32 million bpd in 2019, and much higher than last year’s 11.89 million bpd. U.S. crude output has increased 9 percent year on year, countering OPEC’s efforts to drive oil prices up.


 Despite this positive trend, the growth of the U.S. shale industry is set to slow in August. It hit record highs in June and July, but shale oil production could fall to around 9.4 million bpd in August due to lower output in the Permian Basin, according to a government report. This lower production level could contribute to a global deficit by the end of the year. Oil producers have recently been favouring an increase in returns to shareholders above spending on operations, which marks a distinct shift in strategy, having previously pursued higher production at any cost.   Related: Saudi Aramco Closes In On Walmart As World’s Top Firm By Revenue Several of the most lucrative oil basins have been leased by firms that are following this strategy, biding their time, and waiting for the optimal moment to increase production. This also reflects the volatility of oil prices, which have fallen significantly since last year’s post-Covid, post-invasion peak. Further, several wells have been drilled but are yet to be operational. Nevertheless, mid-term output in the Permian basin is expected to rise, by around 40 percent by 2030, as it peaks before starting to decline.  In recent months, the number of shale rigs in U.S. waters has been declining at the fastest rate since the pandemic. This is due to a variety of reasons, including the number of private companies cutting their rig fleets. Private drillers are thought to have contributed around 70 percent of the decrease in rig numbers. Many small firms went full throttle in their drilling operations last year, following the Russian conflict with Ukraine, Biden’s plea to domestic producers to ramp up production, and extraordinarily high oil prices. But, as oil prices fall, many of these firms’ oil resources are drying up, a trend that is expected to continue for the rest of the year.  Many larger companies are taking a break from drilling, with the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas falling from around 800 at the start of the year to just 670 in July. And more prominent public companies are focusing on maintenance rather than growth when it comes to drilling. With many sitting on potentially lucrative wells, that they plan to tap into on their own timeline. Several oil firms have stated the importance of higher oil prices for their operations. For example, Element Petroleum’s CEO, Taylor Sell, explained that the break-even price of drilling operations had risen substantially in recent months, due to higher material costs, to reach between $55 and $60 a barrel. The price of components such as steel pipes has increased by around 40 percent in the last year and a half, making the fall in oil prices deter many operators from drilling. This led Element to pull out its only active rig in December, having decided to put drilling on hold until the price of oil picked up.  And it’s not only Element feeling the pinch, with inflation and less-productive wells pushing up the break-even price for several companies. In the Delaware region of the Permian, this figure has increased by over 34 percent, to $43 a barrel. And in the Midland area, the average break-even price rose by over 39 percent to $47 a barrel. While an average U.S. oil price of $75 a barrel could bring a profit, low natural gas prices have harmed cash flows. In addition, the limited pipeline capacity of several firms means they are having to rely on gas flaring, a practice that many in the Permian region hoped to cut in line with decarbonisation aims. 


 Following a year of record-high oil production in the U.S., output is likely to drop in the coming months due to wells drying up, a change in strategy, and low oil prices deterring immediate drilling activities. While U.S. shale patches will continue to provide oil resources for several years yet, many companies are pausing operations to ensure they use their remaining reserves wisely, when the time and price are right.   ",Negative
How US Crude Has Helped Stabilize Global Oil Markets.html,"Nearly two years ago, British oil and gas supermajor BP Plc (NYS:BP) announced that the North Sea crude price Dated Brent, the company’s most important pricing benchmark, was experiencing “regular dislocations.”Back then, it was not uncommon for a handful of traders to sometimes hold as much as 40% of the world’s total crude supply in some months, allowing them immense power to manipulate the markets. Indeed, BP warned of trouble for both the gauge itself and Brent futures, a massive market used to not only hedge physical transactions but also to speculate. Luckily, the inclusion of the United States' WTI Midland into the benchmark has vastly widened the pool of tradeable cargoes and made dated Brent more liquid and less susceptible to sudden price moves. The total supply of benchmark grades including Brent, Oseberg, Ekofisk, Forties,  Troll and now WTI Midland has almost doubled, meaning that even though some traders are still able to build up large positions, the volume outside their control has increased dramatically.


 “Falling supply has been the biggest problem for Brent, so the whole idea of the inclusion of WTI Midland was to increase liquidity and prevent squeeze in the Brent benchmark, ” Adi Imsirovic, director of consultant Surrey Clean Energy and a veteran trader, has told Bloomberg. A good case in point of the important role U.S. crude is playing in stabilizing prices can be seen recently. About three weeks ago, a total of 12 bids were placed without finding any sellers. Despite this, prices of major North Sea grades hardly barged.  The inclusion of WTI Midland into Brent also prevents North Sea producers from putting their own cargoes into so-called chains. Chains, usually the cheapest grades, allow a company with forward contracts to sell actual barrels of oil to another firm, providing a link between paper and physical markets. Since early May, WTI Midland has dominated chains, turning the tables on Forties thanks to the U.S. grade being cheaper despite its superior quality. U.S. Shale Production Hits Record Highs Another reason why U.S. crude will continue to dominate global markets is that supply has ramped up rather sharply. Last year, oil prices hit multi-decade highs shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting the Biden administration to urge U.S. producers and OPEC to ramp up production at a faster clip so as to rein in spiraling oil prices. However, Saudi Arabia and its allies responded by doing the exact opposite, cutting production when oil prices started plummeting. Predictably, the United States and Europe were irked by the cartel’s defiance, with President Joe Biden’s administration accusing Saudi Arabia of colluding with Russia and supporting its war in Ukraine. Well, President Biden can at least thank his lucky stars that the U.S. Shale Patch paid heed to his clarion call: the Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecast total U.S. output will hit 12.61M bbl/day in the current year, eclipsing the previous record of 12.32M bbl/day set in 2019's and easily beating last year's 11.89M bbl/day.  U.S. crude oil output is up 9% Y/Y blunting OPEC’s efforts to keep supplies low in a bid to goose prices.


 There is little doubt the U.S. shale patch is doing its best to keep the market well supplied: Rystad Energy has estimated that whereas OPEC and its allies have announced cuts amounting to ~6% of 2022's production, non-OPEC supply has made up for two-thirds of those cuts, with the U.S. accounting for half of that. Energy experts have generally been bearish about U.S. crude supply with many arguing it has already peaked, “The projection suggests the pace of US shale growth, one of the few sources of major new supply in recent year, is slowing despite oil prices hovering at around $90 a barrel, about double most domestic producers’ breakeven costs. If the trend continues, it would deprive the global market of additional barrels to help make up for OPEC+ production cuts and disruption to Russian supplies amid its invasion of Ukraine,” Bloomberg said. Bloomberg cited comments by ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) CEO Ryan Lance that rising costs as well as limited supplies of labor and equipment were some of the problems that were hamstringing efforts by U.S. shale producers to quickly ramp up production. However, Bloomberg also noted that the biggest factor behind the slowdown is a change of the playbook by the majority of U.S. shale companies from focussing on growth and expansion to more capital discipline and returning more cash to shareholders. Luckily for the shale patch, improving drilling and cost efficiency not only means they are able to squeeze more for less but they are also able to eke out a profit at much lower oil prices. According to J.P. Morgan, U.S. drilling and fracking costs have declined 36% since 2014, significantly lowering the breakeven points of many producers. For instance JPM points out that increased efficiency means EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), for example, can earn as much from oil priced at $42/bbl today as it would have from $86/bbl oil in 2014; in contrast, Saudi Arabia reportedly requires ~$81/bbl oil to balance its books. The U.S. shale revolution dramatically reshaped the world energy markets. The shale boom was one of the most impressive growth stories, from take off in 2008 to the Permian stealing the mantle from Saudi Arabia’s Ghawar as the world’s highest producing oilfield in a little over a decade.

Oil Exploration Grows But Discovered Volumes Fall To New Lows.html,"Spending on conventional oil and gas exploration is rebounding and expected to top $50 billion this year, the highest since 2019, but operators are still waiting for the results they had hoped for. Rystad Energy research shows that despite the rising investments, discovered volumes are falling to new lows.  Our estimates show that in the first half of 2023, explorers found 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), 42% lower than the first half of 2022 total of 4.5 billion boe. Fifty-five discoveries have been made, compared to 80 in the first six months of last year. This means discoveries in 2023 have averaged 47 million boe, lower than the 56 million boe per discovery for the same period in 2022. The exploration and production (E&P) industry is in a transitionary period, with many companies exercising increased caution and shifting their strategies to target more profitable and geologically better-understood regions. This strategic shift and the failure of several critical high-potential wells are contributing to the precipitous drop.  In the hunt for new resources, exploration companies are prioritizing the offshore sector, trying to capitalize on underexplored or frontier areas to unlock new volumes through high-risk, higher-cost offshore developments. The offshore industry accounted for about 95% of exploration spending this year to date but only about two-thirds of discovered volumes.  “Upstream companies are facing a period of uncertainty. They are eager to capitalize on the increased demand for fossil fuels and find additional resources, but recent results have been lackluster. If exploration efforts continue to yield unimpressive results for the remainder of the year, 2023 could be a record-breaker for the wrong reasons,” says Aatisha Mahajan, vice president of upstream research at Rystad Energy.   Where are the resources? The continued growth of Guyana’s Stabroek offshore block means the Caribbean country leads the way in discovered volumes, with 603 million boe in 2023. Turkey sits second with 380 million boe, Nigeria with 296 million boe and Namibia with 287 million boe, with the potential for these estimates to grow as we better understand the reserves. Offshore discoveries are spread relatively evenly between ultra-deepwater, deepwater and shelf finds. However, we expect increased activity in the remainder of 2023, especially in the ultra-deepwater market, with projected growth of 27% versus 2022 in terms of spud wells.  Failed high-impact wells Our research shows that 31 high-impact wells – designated using our tiering system based on the project’s significance and production potential – are expected to be drilled this year. So far, 13 have been completed, six are ongoing and 12 remain in the pipeline. Only four of the 13 completed wells encountered hydrocarbons, a measly 31% success rate. The results of three wells are not yet disclosed, while the remaining six failed to find any reserves. These failures significantly impact the total discovered resources and greatly contribute to the falling discoveries. Majors continue to drive spending The six majors – ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Eni and Chevron – continue to play a critical role in global exploration, with a prominent share of exploration spending and global conventional discovered volumes. The six companies are expected to spend about $7 billion this year on exploration, about 10% higher than in 2022.  Exploration activity will likely gain momentum in the second half of 2023, with crucial exploration wells planned to be drilled. Our forecasts show that the majors will contribute about 14% of total global exploration spending in the coming months, highlighting their relative significance in an environment where exploration has pivoted to the offshore sector, with an increased focus on frontier regions. These underexplored or virgin regions hold some of the most technically prospective yet-to-be-drilled prospects, with majors playing a vital role in recent years in exploring these areas. The spending and activity profiles of the majors position them firmly in the market, but national oil companies (NOC) have the most extensive subsurface resource base at their collective disposal. More than half of the projected exploration spending in 2023 will come from NOCs and NOCs with international portfolios (INOC). However, there may yet be some success to come this year, as only 30% of anticipated wells have been completed, highlighting the magnitude of the remaining activity. Only 23 of the remaining 56 exploration wells are either drilled or are expected to be drilled this year, meaning about 60% are likely to be drilled or postponed until 2024. So, even if 2023 proves unsuccessful, a rebound could be on the cards next year.",Neutral
Saudi Arabia Looks To Sidestep OPEC Output Cuts With Dark Inventory.html,"Happily for Saudi Arabia, it does not take a genius to work out that persuading its OPEC+ brothers to cut their oil production to ramp up prices and then quietly selling additional oil over and above its official quota is a major money spinner. “Saudi Arabia has a long history of doing this, so it’s no surprise that it’s looking to increase its oil sales through extra production from the PNZ [Partitioned Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait], particularly as the area’s so off the radar, and Russia has been doing the same with its oil for months,” a senior source in the European Union (E.U.) energy security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. According to the source, although the joint statement by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on 9 July said that accelerated efforts to complete joint oil projects in the PNZ are to meet local energy demands, in reality they are to provide Saudi Arabia with off-the-radar – ‘dark inventory’ – oil that it can sell through various backdoor methods at currently inflated prices, without being seen to break its official OPEC+ quota. “[Oil] industry data shows that no production cuts of any kind – including those mandated by OPEC+ on Saudi Arabia or Kuwait – have been made from fields in the PNZ so far this year,” he added.  The PNZ covers a 2,230 square mile area where Saudi Arabia’s northeastern border meets the southeastern border of Kuwait. It is thought to contain reserves of around 30 billion barrels of oil and 60 trillion cubic feet of gas and is home to the onshore fields of Wafra, Fuwaris, and Humma, and the offshore fields of Khafji, and Hout, among others. The offshore Khajfi field is operated by Saudi Arabia’s Aramco Gulf Operations Co. and Kuwait Gulf Oil Co. (KGOC), a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp., while the onshore Wafra site is operated by KGOC and Saudi Arabian Chevron (SAC). Oil production over the past year or so has hovered around 175,000 barrels per day (level), but according to the senior E.U. energy source, this could relatively easily be increased to 300,000 bpd and, with a little more difficulty to 500,000 bpd. The basic agreement between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is that the proceeds from the PNZ’s oil and gas are split equally between the two countries.  Related: Biden Administration Proposes Hike In Fuel Economy Standards One major complication in assessing the true oil and gas potential of the PNZ and of extracting that on a sustained basis was that Saudi Arabia shutdown production from the area in a decision made in 2014 after Kuwait accused it of renewing Chevron’s Wafra oil field concession licence without consultation. The official Saudi explanation for the closure was that the Khafji field was that it was not compliant with new environmental air emission standards issued by Saudi Arabia’s ‘Presidency of Meteorology and Environment Authority’. Supposedly, the field had sprung a gas leak in one of its 15 platforms, which apparently necessitated the entire PNZ being shut down for five years. The unofficial version, related to OilPrice.com at the time by senior energy sources in the U.S.’s and the E.U.’s energy security departments, was that shutting the field down was Saudi Arabia’s way of keeping Kuwait in line. Specifically in this context, Kuwait had increased its competition to Saudi Arabia in the key Asian export markets to the point that it was selling oil to buyers there at the widest discount to the comparable Saudi grade for 10 years. Additionally, Kuwait had also been placing obstacles to the Kingdom’s own operations in the Wafra region of the PNZ by increasing the difficulty for Saudi Arabian Chevron to obtain work permits to operate in the Zone. This was also seen as a threat to SAC’s ability to move ahead with its full-field steam injection project in Wafra that was intended to boost output of heavy oil there by more than 80,000 bpd. A second major complication over the PNZ has taken on greater geopolitical significance since March’s resumption of relationship deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran - brokered by China, as analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order – while Kuwait still retains better relations with the U.S. and its allies. The issue is which country, or pairing of countries, has the rights to the huge ‘Dorra’ gas field, as it is known by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or ‘Arash’ as Iran calls it. Estimates as to how much gas this field contains vary wildly from around 10 trillion cubic feet of reserves in place to about 60 trillion cubic feet, as do estimates of production it might reach. These run from around 800 million cubic feet per day to just over 1 billion cubic feet per day. A median average estimate of the amount of oil in place is around the 300 million barrels mark, with the daily production median average estimate being around 84,000 bpd. The field is located in shallow waters in the northern Arabian Gulf, to the northeast of Saudi Arabia, the east of Kuwait, and the west of Iran. In gas and oil field terms, the field lies to the east of Kuwait’s huge onshore Burgan oilfield, and east of its Wafra oilfield - part of the PNZ.  Given China’s involvement now in the affairs of both Saudi Arabia and Iran, it seems unlikely that any resolution on the ‘Dorra/Arash’ issue will benefit Kuwait. China’s support for Saudi Arabia in broad terms will provide further backing for any further plans it might have in taking as much of the oil and gas from the shared resources of the PNZ and selling them off quietly, regardless of its OPEC+ production cut quota. As highlighted by the E.U, source, this is nothing new for Saudi Arabia, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. Even at the end of 2016 when the Oil Price War started in 2014 by Saudi Arabia had crippled the finances of its fellow OPEC members and a new production cut deal was needed to bring oil prices back up, the de facto leader of OPEC, utilised its own strategic oil stockpile to sell up to 350,000 bpd via several investment banks into the spot market in a rolling dark inventory sales plan, according to several sources exclusively spoken to by OilPrice.com at the time. OPEC member Venezuela then followed suit, with a deal struck with China to safeguard its own interests. It was precisely because of these cheats on the OPEC production cut deal just after the end of the 2014-2016 Oil Price War that led to its failure to lift oil prices effectively. This, in turn, led to the understanding by OPEC members that a new member with credibility in the oil market be admitted to all future OPEC deals, with that new member being Russia. It might seem odd to those unfamiliar with the oil market – or to those in it who simply believe what they are told by its key players without any further questions being asked – that Saudi Arabia needs the oil from the PNZ to boost its finances. Over and above the fact that its finances are still in a highly precarious state, Saudi Arabia still does not have anywhere near the oil reserves or production capabilities that it has long said it has. As analysed in forensic detail in my new book on the new global oil market order, the crude oil production figures that Saudi Arabia has long bandied around as being fact are no such thing. Far from being able to produce 10, 11 or 12 or more million barrels per day (bpd), Saudi Arabia has struggled to produce anything over 9 million bpd. To be accurate: from 1 January 1973 to Monday 31 July 2023 Saudi Arabia’s average crude oil production is 8.257 million bpd. This means that its equally much-vaunted spare capacity of around 2 million bpd is also not true, founded as it is on a false baseline crude oil production capability. Consequently, being able to sell much of the PNZ’s oil (and gas) production quietly at currently inflated prices – over and above its official OPEC+ quota – would have considerable appeal to Saudi Arabia. And it is something it has done many times before.",Neutral
Bright Economic Outlook Could Lift Oil Prices Even Higher.html,"Brent oil prices broke out of the $75-$80 range they had been stuck in for months and rallied to a three-month high of over $85 per barrel as the market begins to see evidence of tightening and expects fresh stimulus in China to provide a boost to the economy and oil demand later this year.   Banks and analysts expect large deficits this quarter as supply is shrinking, courtesy of the OPEC+ production and export cuts, while demand is robust despite fears of recessions and an underwhelming Chinese economic performance. 


 Going forward, inventory drawdowns loom, and additional Chinese economic stimulus is expected. Meanwhile, OPEC+ is unlikely to unwind all the cuts all at once as it is eager to support “the stability of the market,” namely, relatively high oil prices at above $80 per barrel, analysts say.  Recent economic data from the United States have made traders more optimistic that the Fed could pull off a ‘soft landing’—managing to rein in inflation without causing a deep recession, despite raising last week the key interest rate to the highest in 22 years. Market participants are also optimistic that China’s authorities will roll out additional support to the economy after disappointing growth and factory activity so far this year.  Brighter Economic Prospects    “The staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said last week after the latest rate hike.   Last month, Goldman Sachs cut its probability that a U.S. recession would start in the next 12 months further, from 25% to 20%, due to the fact that the recent economic data have reinforced the bank’s confidence that “bringing inflation down to an acceptable level will not require a recession,” wrote Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm’s chief economist. Following the Fed rate hike on July 26, Goldman’s Hatzius told the Financial Times,   “We believe the Fed is on track for a soft landing.” In addition, the prospects of China’s oil demand and expected further economic stimulus in the world’s top crude importer have played the biggest role in the oil price rally in July, according to Goldman Sachs. Oil prices ended the month of July with the biggest monthly gain since January 2022 and the strongest July performance in nearly two decades.  Hopes that China will support further its economy, record-high global oil demand, and a substantial drop in supply in July and August have boosted market optimism in recent weeks.  Fundamentals Point To Higher Prices, Too


 Oil market fundamentals are signaling bullishness ahead, even more than the most recent interpretation of the near-term prospects for the global economy.  Inventories are falling in the United States and Europe, analysts have told Reuters.  Yet, Chinese inventories have been rising as the world’s top crude oil importer has accelerated stockpiling to the highest rate in three years, taking advantage of cheaper Russian oil and boosting total crude imports in June to the second-highest monthly imports on record.   This month and next, a market deficit will emerge and further grow as demand reaches record highs while supply shrinks, analysts say.  Moreover, the market expects Saudi Arabia, the world’s top crude oil exporter and OPEC+ leader, to extend its 1 million bpd production cut into September, too. The Kingdom is cutting its production by 1 million bpd in July and August, on top of around 500,000 bpd reduction as part of the OPEC+ cuts that began in May. Russia has pledged a 500,000 bpd cut to August oil exports, and signs suggest Russian crude shipments are already falling.  As a result, analysts see hefty inventory drawdowns in the coming months, which are set to support oil prices.  Demand looks stronger than many had expected early in the second quarter.  Oil demand outside China is holding up “far better” than most have feared, while the very aggressive OPEC+ cuts are leading to a deficit on the market, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs’s global head of commodities research, told CNBC on Monday.

 ADVERTISEMENT Inventories in July are looking like they have declined by around 2.2 million bpd, he told CNBC, adding, “That’s big and that just reinforces the potential for more upside.”    The world’s oil demand hit a record high of 102.8 million bpd in July, Goldman’s analysts wrote in a note on Sunday. The bank expects the robust demand to lead to a wider-than-expected deficit of as much as 1.8 million bpd in the second half of 2023, and to 600,000 bpd deficit in 2024. As a result of those deficits, Brent prices could rise to $93 a barrel in the second quarter of 2024, according to Goldman Sachs.   “The market has abandoned its growth pessimism,” the Wall Street bank’s analysts wrote in the note.  Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said on the last trading day of July, “Crude prices are finishing a solid month on a high note as demand prospects remain impressive and no one doubts that OPEC+ will keep this market tight.”    “The ace up the sleeve of oil bulls is that the energy market is still awaiting massive stimulus from China that should boost global growth prospects.” ",Positive
Will Oil Prices Hit 100 By Years End.html,"OPEC is producing less oil thanks to the Saudi voluntary cuts and a suspension of crude oil loadings at Nigeria’s Forcados terminal due to a leak risk. The figures vary depending on the source, but a Reuters survey has suggested the group pumped 840,000 bpd less in July than in June. And they are not showing any signs of reconsidering.


 The results are already visible: oil prices are up and rising, with Brent topping $85 per barrel earlier this week while WTI climbed closer to $82 per barrel. The question now is how high they will reach before OPEC begins to roll back the cuts. The other question: will it be able to boost production fast enough if necessary? Analysts have previously said that Saudi Arabia needs oil at $90 per barrel to continue with its ambitious public spending plans that make up the Vision 2030 diversification program. Yet if prices are left to climb too high, it would begin to sap demand and have a boomerang effect that neither the Saudis nor their fellow OPEC members would want to experience. Still, this might be just the beginning of a rally because while Saudi Arabia has been cutting production deliberately, Nigeria and Angola have been unable to produce as much as their OPEC quota states. And Libya’s output has been disrupted yet again while production growth in the U.S. shale patch slows down. If all the demand projections that have been instrumental in driving this latest rally materialize, this means oil could hit $100 again before the year’s end. That prospect becomes especially plausible in light of reports that crude oil inventories in some parts of the world are on the decline. Before, global oil and fuel inventory levels did not have much of an impact on international oil prices, but this has now changed because of Western sanctions on Russia, JP Morgan analysts said this week. The reason: more oil and fuels are being traded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. With that currency diversification, the level of actual physical supply of the commodities traded has grown in importance as a factor affecting their prices. And demand has now returned to the spotlight of traders.


 Both OPEC and the International Energy Agency estimate the annual demand growth pace for 2023 at over 2 million barrels daily. OPEC sees it at 2.4 million bpd. The IEA sees demand growing by 2.2 million bpd, although it has warned oil demand growth will slow “significantly” over the medium term. The latest import and inventory figures from China confirm the sense of robust oil demand, with the country seen by virtually everyone as the single largest oil demand driver globally. Imports are running at near-record levels, and oil in storage is rising fast. This would also give China leverage over prices if they climb too high, with analysts suggesting that once Beijing becomes uncomfortable with prices, it would start selling crude from storage in what would basically be a repeat of President Biden’s SPR release last year. It would all depend on how long Saudi Arabia is willing to stick to its voluntary cuts. The latest GDP figures suggest its economy slowed down in the second quarter as oil prices declined. Now that prices are on the rebound, so will probably be the Saudi economy, giving Riyadh good reason to continue capping oil output. Russia, meanwhile, is drilling for oil at record levels, according to data reported by Bloomberg. The number of new production wells drilled in the first half of the year was 6.6.% higher than planned and 8.6% than the amount drilled over the first half of 2022.

The Imminent Peak In Permian Oil What Does it Mean For Investors.html,"In this article, I will update the general trends now being observed with daily production out of the Permian basin. In past articles, I’ve discussed the fact that it was clear that the quality of Permian acreage remaining to drill was on the decline. As this basin is the only major oil producer continuing to add barrels of daily output, this has broad implications for supply and prices. In the June 2023 edition of the EIA-914, the monthly forecast on oil and gas output, the Permian is shown with a slight decline for the July/August time period. This is the first time since Feb of 2021 this has occurred during the Snowmageddon of 2021. Whatever you think about the longevity of this basin, one thing is absolutely undeniable. We are currently extracting nearly 2 bn BOE annually from it. Over the last five years we've withdrawn more than 6 bn BOE. Since we began fracking about 15 years ago, we've pumped out ~14 bn BOE. We’ve been climbing the hill in Hubbert’s Peak, and soon the descent will begin.


 We will also discuss one way to play the information I will present here. In the coming quarters, we believe there will be an increasingly sharp demarcation between winners and losers. Already there are companies exhibiting signs of landing in the former category. Please read on for a top pick in the shale category. Hubbert’s Peak in the Permian Natural Resources analyst firm, Goerhring & Rosenscwajg-G&R, has modeled production trends that suggest that ""Hubbert's Peak"" for the Permian will hit late next year. Hubbert was a geologist who theorized that once half a basin's reserves had been recovered, it would have essentially “peaked.”  The graph below, taken from a G&R report highlights their expectations. G&R could be of some, but the point remains, there is an inflection point coming that will tilt the slope downward. The firm estimates using their models that about 20 bn barrels of commercially recoverable oil remain in the basin. At current production rates, that’s about 11 years of output.  That’s a good bit less than some other estimates, including the one put out by the Enervus, an energy analyst firm, which uses data from the U.S. Geophysical Survey-USGS, projects another 50 bn barrels could be produced. Time will tell as to what the final tallies will be, but the data coming in now supports G&R’s analysis regarding a midpoint that will come late next year. Acreage quality One indicator is that much of the best acreage has been drilled. This is a point I've made many times in past articles. During the low-price era from 2017-2020, many companies pulled forward their Tier I- ""geological parameters such as thickness, thermal maturity, organic content, oil in place, porosity, and permeability to make accurate well-quality predictions,"" acreage for it to meet investment thresholds and payout requirements. When prices are low, you develop your best assets. In their report G&R put their finger on this aspect of the aging of Permian potential. “We turned to advanced methods, including machine learning and neural networks, and achieved surprising results. Instead of improved drilling techniques, we concluded that two-thirds of the improved productivity between 2013-2018 came from favoring the best drilling locations. In 2013, 22% of Midland wells were Tier 1. By 2018, Tier 1 represented 50% of all wells. Since a Tier 1 well is nearly twice as productive as a Tier 2 well, the migration from lower to higher quality areas drove a massive amount of the improved well productivity.” Technology impact In a recent Special Report for OilPrice, The Future of Oil and Gas, we discussed how technology was extending the economics and productivity of new wells in shale reservoirs. By virtue of longer horizontal intervals, increased completion intensity, and a better understanding of optimal spacing to minimize interface between wells among other things, the output from shale reservoirs has been increased. But, there is no free lunch, and technology proves to have limits in its ability to generate increasing amounts of oil and gas per foot of interval. The graph below from the G&R report we’ve been discussing highlights this decline in productivity. Productivity per foot of interval is dropping.


  Parent well, child-well relationships are in play here. As G&R notes in their commentary, “Child” wells-which are wells subsequent to and often “side-tracked” from an original borehole, are not as prolific typically as the “Parent,” well. “In the early days of shale development, producers would often drill a single horizontal well to test different parts of the basin and satisfy lease obligations that often require drilling a well within an allotted period. Later, the developer returns to the best areas and drills several more wells from a single pad to develop the resource economically. Producers now realize that the so-called “child” wells produce between 5 and 20% less oil than expected. In 2012 we estimate that only 30% of wells drilled in the three significant shale basins were “children.” By 2022, that figure had reached 85%. In Tier 1 areas, effectively, all current wells are children, with lower-than-expected productivity.” In short, as parent wells water out and are plugged, there will be a more rapid decline than we have seen thus far as the active well count consists more and more of child wells. Your takeaway What all of this means when considering investing in a shale producer, the quality of the rock, and the blockiness of their surface acreage, which drives inventory, are two key features that will form our long-term investing thesis. I have always maintained that Devon Energy, (NYSE:DVN) would be in the top tier of shale producers for these reasons. Clay Gaspar, President of Devon comments on their latest 6-well pad development in Lea County, New Mexico- “Individual wells at Exotic Cat flowed at rates over 7,200 BOE per day and well -- per well recoveries from this pad are on track to exceed two million barrels of oil equivalent. The flow rate from this activity rank among the very best projects Devon has ever brought online in the basin.”  Using simple math, with six wells online producing 7,200 BOEPD, Exotic Cat Raider should return its ~$60-70 mm capital cost in about 2-3 months. In this scenario, at the 2-month period, approximately 2.59 mm BOE have been produced, leaving another 9.41 mm BOE to be produced. Natural declines will impact this calculation in reality, extending the payout time somewhat, but the simple math looks pretty good. No wonder Mr. Gaspar was so enthusiastic.

 ADVERTISEMENT The next metric we need to review is inventory depth. At their current rate of development, ~250 Delaware wells per year, there remains a 12-year Risked inventory. As drilling continues and more is learned from the data collected, additional “DeRisking” will add another couple of thousand Top-Tier drilling locations to the total and extend the asset life to ~20 years.  Finally, Devon has proven to be a shrewd inventory consolidator with its acquisition of WPX Energy in 2021. It has also made major inventory additions in other basins. Notably Validus Energy in the Eagle Ford basin in 2022, and RimRock in the Williston basin. G&R closes out their commentary on shale thusly- “Based on current drilling activity, the average publicly traded Permian company will run out of Tier 1 drilling locations within 3.7 years. We firmly believe that as the market realizes how little Tier 1 acreage remains, those with the best inventory will be treated as valuable assets. If we are correct, the age of shale growth is now behind us, and the reality of Hubbert’s Peak is at hand. The immense growth of the shales over the past decade has blinded many analysts to the declining trends in global conventional production. That luxury is about to end.” With all of that in mind, we believe that Devon Energy, trading at <5X EV/EBITDA and $59K per flowing barrel, is substantially undervalued by the market. We also think a near-term trading opportunity will emerge when the company reports on August 2nd, 2023. There is a good chance if Q-2 earnings are missed by the Super Majors, ExxonMobil, (NYSE: XOM), and Chevron, (NYSE: CVX) are any guide, there will be a short-term down draft in shares of DVN. We view this as a buying opportunity below $50 per share.",Neutral
Big Oil Continues To Be Pushed Toward Greener Endeavors.html,"Last year, Big Oil made record profits that got stuck in the throats of governments, activist organizations, and international bodies such as the UN and the IEA. Yet those same governments practically encouraged these profits by subsidizing fuels to avoid even higher inflation and all the problems that such a development would have produced.


 In 2022, with demand for energy roaring back after the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the consequent gas supply squeeze, and fears of a similar oil squeeze, the target that Big Oil had painted on its back temporarily disappeared. Energy security temporarily became more important than decarbonization. That era is over, according to some analysts. Now, the pressure on Big Oil to decarbonize is going to increase. All Big Oil majors except BP reported weaker profits for the second quarter because of the decline in oil and gas prices. BP, which reports on Tuesday, is also expected to book slimmer profits for this year’s second quarter than last year’s. The time of plenty seems to be over. According to the Financial Times, this means that the supply squeeze threat has passed, and now the governments that subsidized diesel and gasoline will once again increase the pressure on the oil industry to go green. In fact, the pressure has never decreased, even when oil was trading above $100 a barrel last year. And despite that pressure, Big Oil has signaled a retreat from earlier ambitious transition targets. It seems everyone got a reality check last year. Only Big Oil came out with different outtakes from that check than the governments that slapped windfall profit taxes on the industry and then worried it would stop investing in more production. The pressure is working: European supermajors have been splashing on various low-carbon projects, from wind and solar capacity to EV chargers. But that was before 2022. This year, BP and Shell basically walked back their decarbonization pledges to the frustration of their activist investors. Those same investors, by the way, received much lower support for their climate-related resolutions at this year’s AGMs than in previous years. The rest of the shareholders must have liked the share repurchase programs and the fatter dividends.


 Meanwhile, the American supermajors, who have generally steered clear of things like wind and solar, are venturing into raw transition materials: Exxon and Chevron both announced forays into lithium mining this year, signaling the potential direction their decarbonization drive would take. The two are also busy expanding their carbon capture capabilities. Exxon, for one, sees a future in which its decarbonization business could one day outgrow its core oil and gas business. In Europe, BP and TotalEnergies just won a tender for offshore wind capacity in Germany, essentially beating the wind industry on its own turf. Just because the leadership of these companies has signaled it will go easy on the whole decarbonization affair doesn’t mean it will pass on opportunities to benefit from generous government funding for wind and solar. Big Oil has been under the microscope for years now, with governments, regulators, and activists all watching the industry closely for any suggestion they might want to expand their core business. Yet when they did do that, activists protested last year as expected, but governments didn’t. Governments in Europe spent billions on fuel subsidies contributing to Big Oil’s massive profits. In the U.S., President Biden and his energy secretary pleaded with Big Oil to boost oil production after actively working to make boosting oil production as difficult as possible. Now, decarbonization is back on the table as a top concern amid a ramp-up in the climate emergency talk from officials such as the UN’s Antonio Guterres. But the perception that the supply squeeze threat is over, as suggested by the Financial Times last week, may well be wrong.

 ADVERTISEMENT Oil and gas prices are palpably lower now than they were this time last year, but they are on the climb. And the reason they are on the climb is that fears are growing that demand for oil will soon exceed supply thanks to OPEC+ efforts to prop up prices and unrelenting demand growth, despite price movements. The current situation is somewhat paradoxical: national and international government officials are calling for the decarbonization of the hydrocarbons industry. At the same time, they are forecasting higher demand for these same hydrocarbons and, in the case of the IEA, warning that this higher demand would result in a deficit. It would be reasonable to suggest that this means decarbonization efforts are not exactly going as planned. The reason for this is that the need for energy is immediate and pressing. People need energy right now and not in five years. And Big Oil is happy to help while it invests in that new energy capacity that will be up and running in five years thanks to government subsidies.",Positive
The Dark Fleet How Unknown Traders Keep Russian Oil Flowing.html,"Newly established commodity trading firms incorporated in Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have replaced trading and oil giants in handling Russian crude oil and products after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the EU and G7 sanctions and price caps that followed.   By some estimates, these one-year-old or younger trading companies have shipped at least half of all the Russian crude and refined products exports so far this year.


 While major oil traders and supermajors backed out of dealing with Russian oil, many trading firms were incorporated in jurisdictions outside Europe and took over most of the trade with Russian oil with the help of many middlemen—often the ‘shadow fleet’ of tankers. This ‘dark fleet’ has expanded from shipping sanctioned Iranian and Venezuelan oil to include transportation of Russian crude and products.  The business of transporting Russian crude to Asia has become “crazy good,” a trader dealing with Russian oil told Reuters early this year.  Most of the shipping companies transporting Russian crude—without breaching the sanctions and price cap—are based in the UAE, Greece, India, and China, and some of them are partially owned by Russian firms, according to numerous anonymous banking and trading sources who spoke to Reuters.  Russian oil firms have managed to find in recent months little-known traders willing to ship their oil, thus boosting export revenues.  For example, state-controlled Rosneft, the top oil producer in Russia, has just concluded one of its biggest tenders in recent years to award export contracts to traders, sources with knowledge of the tender told The Wall Street Journal last week.   Unlike last year’s flops in Rosneft’s tenders, the tender held in recent weeks has secured export volumes for the Russian oil giant. And the big winners are newly-created oil traders incorporated outside Europe. These are Hong-Kong-based Bellatrix Energy, as well as UAE-incorporated Amur and Tejarinaft, according to the Journal’s sources.  The three little-known firms have been large exporters of Russian oil since the oil price cap of $60 per barrel and the EU embargo on seaborne Russian imports came into effect last December, per industry executives and Russian customs data seen by the WSJ.  Russian crude and petroleum product exports held high in the first half of this year, contrary to many expectations of a slump in Russian exports after the embargo. The newly-created trading firms have played a key role in keeping those exports high. 


 The trading firms that have emerged after the sanctions were announced in the summer of last year are estimated to have handled at least half of the Russian crude and petroleum product exports so far this year, per estimates by Reuters based on information from numerous trade sources and data from Eikon.  So far this year, Russia has exported around 8 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and refined products.  However, signs have emerged in recent weeks that Russian exports are falling, while India—a top Russian crude customer alongside China—may have already reached its peak crude imports from Russia, some analysts say. Total oil exports out of Russia slumped by 600,000 bpd in June, to the lowest level in more than two years, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its latest Oil Market Report in July.  Russia’s oil exports declined by 600,000 bpd to 7.3 million bpd in June, which was the lowest level of oil exports from the country since March 2021, per IEA’s estimates.

 ADVERTISEMENT Russia’s crude oil exports by sea alone continue to plunge and are now well below the February levels and nearly 1.5 million bpd lower than the recent peak at the end of April, according to tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg.    Russia’s crude shipments plunged by 311,000 bpd to 2.73 million bpd in the week to July 23, as exports out of the Western ports on the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea crashed to 1.17 million bpd, down by 625,000 bpd from the previous week, according to the data. ",Negative
UK Windfall Tax Here to Stay Despite Energy Sector Overhaul.html,"Downing Street’s latest energy announcements this morning will not lead to a reversal in the controversial windfall tax, despite industry hopes of it being softened to make the country’s investment climate more attractive. Many of the new measures were trailed in the media before they were announced today, including the pledges for carbon capture and storage and at least 100 more oil and gas licences in the North Sea.


 These proposals will likely provoke a reaction from climate protestors and activists, including Just Stop Oil – which have been active with demonstrations across the country since last summer. But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appeared to pull a rabbit out of the hat with confirmation of a review of the oil and gas sector’s tax regime, with a potential announcement later this year. This will not , however, mean the windfall tax – first introduced by Sunak and toughened under Chancellor Jeremy Hunt – will be removed any time soon. In its call for evidence from the industry, the government confirmed that the focus is on the long-term investment climate of the North Sea, and that changes to the Energy Profits Levy will not be considered. For now, it appears Downing Street considers its recent introduction of a so-called ‘price floor’ – the Energy Security Investment Mechanism – will be sufficient. This withdraws the windfall tax when oil prices decline to $71.40 per barrel and gas prices slide below 54p per therm. Brent Crude oil is currently priced at $85.10 per barrel, while gas is priced at 67.7p per therm on the UK’s benchmark, well above the thresholds. In contrast to industry hopes, the consultation will focus on the investment climate beyond March 2028, when the Energy Profits Levy will finally conclude, so the windfall tax should stay until then. Robin Allan, chairman of the association, told City A.M. he welcomed today’s announcement of funding for new carbon capture projects and at least 100 further North Sea oil and gas licences, but warned that that the country’s “broader fiscal regime remains uncompetitive.” “We look forward to responding to the planned review of taxes on the sector. Whilst we remain concerned that the UK’s broader fiscal regime remains uncompetitive, this consultation will be a great opportunity to review net zero capital allowances, which can support the North Sea oil and gas sector’s commitment to decarbonise the supply chain.”


 This perspective was backed by Ithaca Energy, which argued that “fiscal stability is paramount for the industry given the large and long duration of capital investments.” A spokesperson told City A.M.: “The Energy Profits Levy in its current form continues to impact investment across the UK North Sea with windfall taxes remaining despite softening in commodity prices and profits no longer being windfall in nature.” As it stands, the Energy Profits Levy is set at 35 per cent and runs through to its end date despite fossil fuel prices and wholesale costs easing – with the government not expected to trigger its price floor at any point over the next five years. This is on top of the special 40 per cent corporation tax rate oil and gas producers pay – nearly double the rate of other industries. The tax has contributed to North Sea producers pulling out of domestic projects. So far this includes Total slashing £100m plans to work on an infill well on Elgin this year, Enquest planning to leave its Kraken field in the North Sea to “natural decline, and Harbour Energy cutting jobs at its Aberdeen base alongside shifting investment to the US and South America. Meanwhile, Ithaca Energy has been locked in talks with the government over the UK’s investment climate before it moved forward with commitments for Rosebank, as first reported by City A.M. More work to do, warn analysts

 ADVERTISEMENT Free market think tanks remain sceptical, with Andy Mayer, energy analyst at the Institute of Economic Affairs, predicting that the latest announcements will “do little to encourage investments frightened away by windfall taxes.” Maxwell Marlow, director of research at the Adam Smith Institute, told City A.M. the consultation needs to be more ambitious and include plans for free ports and designated low-tax spaces for building new projects. “This consultation should envelop two areas: a low-tax space for plant and building, which means expanding full expensing to rigs, ships, pipelines, and processing facilities. The government should also create free ports around Aberdeen, Shetland, and Bacton, where businesses can better invest in the communities surrounding their production hubs,” he added. “By creating a long-term, low-tax, resilient framework, the government will create the energy security we need to grow at lower costs for businesses and families.”",Neutral
