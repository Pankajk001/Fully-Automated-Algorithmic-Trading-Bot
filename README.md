## Prominent Technical Indicators

MACD, ATR, Bollinger Bands, RSI and ADX are prominent technical indicators used for trend analysis.

Implementations/codes for the same are Provided for each indicators.

## Technical vs. Fundamental Analysis

### Technical Analysis

Technical analysis revolves around the meticulous examination of historical price data and trading volumes to unearth patterns, trends, and signals that can guide trading decisions. Anchored in the belief that past price movements can forecast future ones, technical analysts employ an array of tools including moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands to decipher market psychology and supply-demand dynamics. Algorithmic trading harnesses technical analysis by automating trades based on these quantifiable signals, making it particularly suited for short-term strategies focused on capitalizing on price patterns and trends within concise timeframes.

### Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis undertakes a more profound exploration by delving into a company's financial data, industry trends, macroeconomic indicators, and even geopolitical events to discern an asset's intrinsic value. This approach pivots around the conviction that an asset's underlying worth propels its price over the long haul. By scrutinizing factors like earnings reports, balance sheets, interest rates, GDP growth, inflation rates, and geopolitical shifts, fundamental analysts aim to identify overvalued and undervalued assets. While fundamental analysis is less common in algorithmic trading compared to its technical counterpart, it still has its place. Some algorithms incorporate fundamental analysis to formulate strategies that consider a broader spectrum of variables and may operate on longer-term horizons

### Efficiency Market Hypothesis

The efficiency market hypothesis supports technical analysis, suggesting that markets quickly absorb new information.

### Deeper Exploration

Understanding the foundations of these indicators and coding them in Python is recommended for a comprehensive grasp.

## Exploring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Overview

In the upcoming sections, we'll delve into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that play a pivotal role in back testing.

### Assessing Risk and Return

KPIs measure a strategy's risk and return profiles, forming the foundation of the assessment process.

### Essential KPIs

We'll explore crucial KPIs, including:

- Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
- Volatility
- Sharpe Ratio
- Sortino Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Calmar Ratio

### Understanding Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) as a KPI

Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a vital Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for trading strategies. CAGR provides a standardized measure of an asset's annual return over different timeframes, aiding strategy comparison. It's calculated by raising the end value to the power of 1 divided by the years and subtracting 1. CAGR simplifies performance comparison but doesn't account for risk.

### Understanding Volatility as a Key Risk Metric
volatility is a crucial risk indicator in trading. Volatility, measured by standard deviation, captures return fluctuations. It's annualized for consistency. Despite limitations, volatility is fundamental for quantifying risk and is widely used in finance.

### The Sharpe Ratio  and Sortino Ratio
The Sharpe ratio, calculated by dividing expected return by volatility, measures excess returns adjusted for risk. The Sortino Ratio, focusing on downside volatility, offers an alternative. Both ratios have their merits, and their use depends on risk preferences.

### Maximum Drawdown and Calmar Ratio
Maximum drawdown measures the largest loss, while Calmar Ratio relates return to drawdown. These metrics help evaluate downside risk and inform strategy decisions. Implementing them in Python aids practical understanding.

By understanding and utilizing these metrics, we'll gain valuable insights into the potential risks and rewards associated with our trading strategies.
